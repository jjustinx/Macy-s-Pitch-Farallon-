I took down some product information and notes so that I can run it by him 'cause after all if I'm the one spending the money, I want to make sure that he would be okay with a routine, especially if a regime requires multiple steps (men view facial care differently then women, therefore, the simpler the better). I asked for a business card and she acted suspicious and was trying to negotiate with me over giving me a simple business card. I didn't feel that I needed to explain to her why I needed one.

I was mad because her tone was implying that I was just making up a reason to back up the return. So i said \"I broke out in dots all over my face. \" and I pointed to my face because I still had the rashes to prove it. And she just keeps staring at the computer screen, didn't even bother to look at me and said a dismissive  \"uh huh.\" excuse my language but that right there made her a GIANT bitch in my eyes. \n\nI was pretty offended by her tone because my skin is one of my biggest insecurities and trying to find something that works and constantly having reactions to everything is really just a lot of suffering for me.

Everest to aid their lips from the effects of wind and cold weather. If it was good enough for that kind of extreme condition, it should be good enough for everyday use.\n\nAlthough it did have SPF 4 rating, the ingredients I was allergic to was minute enough not to affect me if I used it once per day.\n\n2. A more compact way than bringing shampoo and a bar of soap for the out of town traveling...\n\nI needed an all-in-one hair and body cleanser that was mild enough for twice a day shampooing as well as remove salt water sediments left on the skin. I came across a product called Kiehl's All-Sport Everyday Shampoo which was supposedly great for swimmers.\n\nAt that time both products met my needs. Kiehl's products then were marketed to have simple, harmless ingredients. I loved the product packaging which had no fanfare - a bottle and slapped on label. And most importantly the stores and especially the stand-alone Kiehl's shops, err I mean, Kiehl's Apothecary boutiques had excellent customer service and support. If you didn't like a product, you can bring it back for a full refund. Trial pouches are also available so you can discover even more Kiehl's products.\n\nFast-forward to 2009 and it all now seems like an expensive body product with questionable ingredients. New products are being introduced every time with a more colourful packaging and labeling. Gone are the days. Rather than have an all-in-one unisex product with all natural ingredients, they are now sliding back into gender-specific designations.\n\nI may have ridiculously spent too much back in the day for Kiehl's.

I asked her where is the sunscreen with the spf located? She replied \"Oh we never carry eye creams with sunscreen at all! With the eye area being so sensitive!\" something along those lines. Firstly, you work at Kiehls and you have no idea what products your store carries/-ed? Secondly, if you/Kiehls actually \"specialize\" in skin care, you'd know that sunscreen around the eyes is important. So I told her I was actually just looking at it online and pulled it up on Google search. \"Oh no, that's the American website!\" I almost rolled my eyes at this point. I then scrolled down a teeny bit, got to the Canadian website and then showed her that Kiehls DID actually carry eye creams with SPF.

I would rather purchase their products at Saks or Nordstroms than go to their Newbury street location. The store has horrible service. I have never been greeted within the first few minutes of entering the store and the staff is never available when you have questions. Just recently I purchased a gift card for $150 and the clerk acted like she was doing me a favor. How inappropriate!\n\nNow, for the reason why I had to Yelp this store. Recently, my boyfriend and I went to the store to get him some products with the gift card that he received from me.\n\nTHE SALES ASSOCIATED TOOK THE GIFT CARD WITHOUT CREDITING IT TOWARDS OUR TRANSACTION AND DID NOT RETURN IT TO US!\n\nMy boyfriend paid unaware of the discrepancy in price since the card had only $40 left on it. It was not until later much that he realized what had occured when looking at his bank statement. $40 lost isn't the end of the world, but it's insult to injury at a store that is already so overpriced.

Bottom line is they make great products, they also dont now and never have relied on or used animal testing. That is a big one for me.

When you throw something in a recycle bin, you're never really sure whats going to happen to it, at least thats the way i think, but here you know your empty will not just be recycled, but reused, which is way different than recycling. The return policy is pretty open as well, i've returned bottles without a receipt and been credited for it. \"I just didn't really like it\" is all I had to say. Also I've been to this Boston store many times and the crew has always been great, friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and, it seems anyway, happy to be there and help.
