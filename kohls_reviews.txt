The percentages off that we do get are more than adequate since we don't actually live in the Kohl's store like this woman apparently does.

My grandmother always took me to the one on West Broad. By comparison, while Kohl's tends to carry the same things at all of its stores, this one seemed a bit more up-scale.

If I need something snazzy for my otherwise gender-neutral look, I can usually find it. No need to go to someplace like Lazarus (oops, sorry, MACY'S for all you out-of-towners and kids who are too young to remember Lazarus) or J.C. Penney's and break the bank for one item. Also, Kohl's has sales that you really can't beat. \n\nI'm the kind of person who avoids the sale racks and heads straight to the clearance racks. Today, for example, I found a shirt that normally retails at for $8 at 80% off. I found a flannel jacket for $24 at 70% off. A winter coat for $60 at 70% off. This is stuff that would normally cost me over $300 at the till. I hate shopping! I hate bargain-hunting! And I struck gold today. What struck me was the sheer quality on the clearance racks. I wouldn't find stuff this nice on the clearance racks at the store on West Broad. The clearance racks at West Broad would be full of stuff your grandmother would wear. No thanks. I'm not into granny clothing now and I never will be.\n\nThe gentleman who processed my order was exceptional. He joked with me, my mom, and my brother (who were in a different line) and he complimented my choice of clothing as if folks like me (gender-neutral and genderqueer folks, that is) came through his till every day. I felt comfortable enough with him to lament my inability to find \"men's\" athletic shoes that I can wear comfortably (I wear a men's 6 or 6.5 depending on the brand) and he peeked over the counter at my feet and said, \"Darn, and we have some [brand] that would work for your look.\" Sir, you just made my day!\n\nThe only thing that didn't sit too well with me was when we came in, I asked where something was and the cashier, who wasn't doing anything, flat-out ignored me.

He drove separately because he was going to get a haircut after and I had our 5 month old son with me. We spent 2 hours in Kohl's trying to find something to wear. We were attending a \"Southern Soiree\" so both of us were unsure what he should wear and tried on a lot of clothes. Not once during that time did a Kohl's representative offer to assist us. Since there was no one available to help us we choose the larger handicapped dressing room that would accommodate the stroller and we could help each other. I went out on the floor multiple times looking to see if someone could help us. I never found anyone until the very end, I found the Men's floor manager which was someone I happen to know. I asked her to measure Matt but after two hours he was leaving to shop elsewhere. He stated he was going to Men's Warehouse so I proceeded to the check out, paid for my purchases and started to leave the store. As I was walking out I heard a man say \"excuse me miss?\" I turned around and it was two police officers. I said \"yes?\" He looked at Nolan and said \"Oh, you have a baby? Do you have any ID?\" I gave him my ID and then he asked if I had ever been arrested. At that point I asked the officer why he was stopping me. He stated, \"well we have been watching you and your boyfriend for 2 hours on the cameras and we saw you get multiple items and go in and out of the dressing room and that our behavior was suspicious. I told him yes we were going to an event tonight and explained what we were doing. I assured him I did not steal anything and he proceeded to tell me that we must have realized they were \"on to us\" and ditched the items we were planning on stealing. I couldn't believe it. Then he asked \"well where is your boyfriend\"? I told him we drove separate cars. He disregarded everything I said, he had already made up his mind I was there to steal. At this point I started getting really upset, I opened my diaper bag, pointed in the stroller and said look, search me if you don't believe me. Then he said again, we know you didn't steal anything, you guys ditched it in the dressing room. He also made it a point to tell me over and over I was being watched. He kept questioning me and insinuating I was there to steal. Even though I knew I didn't do anything wrong, the way this officer was treating me I was scared and afraid I was being arrested with my baby with me. All of this took place in front of the store where people are walking in and out and I am standing there with my son being questioned. I was so embarrassed and humiliated. One of the police officers was a bit more reserved. He didn't say much and actually looked a little embarrassed and uncomfortable. It was the other police officer who was a bully and harassed me. I finally broke down in tears and said you are upsetting me and I am leaving. I called my boyfriend and he was upset as well. He called Kohl's and asked to speak to a manager. I think the floor manager was the one who got on the phone but whoever it was had no idea what had happened. I went to my parent's home to tell them what had happened and broke down in tears. My mom was so upset she called Kohl's to find out what had transpired and why. She spoke to a manager named Derling who told her he would look into it and call her back. He never bothered to call her so she called him Tuesday afternoon to be told it wasn't a Kohl's problem, the store hired extra security for the holiday weekend and this was two Orlando Police Department Officers who questioned her. I am going forward and filing a complaint with the Orlando Police Department for harassment. I feel the situation was handled unjustly and the officer who harassed me should know or be instructed this is unacceptable behavior. And I am sure there is a proper protocol to follow when apprehending a shoplifter. I found his behavior to be appalling. I doubt this would have happened had we been properly taken care. Matt ended up purchasing an entire outfit from The Men's Warehouse where he measured and waited on like a customer should be. Shame on Kohl's for not hiring extra help over a holiday weekend or accepting any responsibility and shame on the Orlando Police Department for spending their valuable time harassing a paying customer.", "date": "2016-02-22 00:34:24"}, {"review_id": "AMiUiHWjeSnmFzvnvAIelA", "user_id": "jTNXTzyWRgIiYCeRkrgURg", "business_id": "-YssodeDvfAlXLctWtQyZw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So many problems with this store.

It appeared many of the shelves were entirely empty and in need of new inventory. About the same amount of empty shelves as full in some departments. Sort of weird.

Ok, let's get to business here.  It's a handy location for the most part; not too far from Medical City.  It's in a nice plaza with Home Depot, Party City, Dollar Tree & Kohl's.  Aside from those 4 places, it's just some fast food and store fronts up by the road.  You'll find Kohl's tucked back on the southern side of the plaza.  There is insanely ample parking (even on Black Friday) so it's always a snap to get out.\n\nEveryone knows that Kohl's promote's the MSRP of an item and then discounts it down what other people sell it for or sometimes more.  I'm not saying you can't get a good deal, but rather that it's pretty well know of their smoke & mirrors approach to making you feel like you're getting a huge savings.\n\nThey did start to carry Rock & Republic which I've always like the fit, so that was positive.  The place is tidy as can be, clean as a whistle, quiet as a mouse and there's not an employee to be found anywhere except DEF at 1 register up front and 1 person in customer service.  \n\nI've been down on my hands and knees trying to sift through jeans that are folded the wrong way and don't show the size tags...oy.

Trust me.. I ended up with $180 in Kohls Cash, plus the following: (and certain times, this includes the $$ spent even on redeeming values!)\n\n3. Yes 2 You rewards. Sign up! You get 1 point for $1 spent and get $5 for every 100 points. I racked up $25 off , just for this! \n\n4. Coupons. They ALWAYS have them. Trust me. Sign up for emails. His the sales, and specials.

I got a great price for the $99.00 beauty light, having paid $55, I thought it was a steal of a deal, but my wife disagreed concerned it may be bad for her skin. When we went to return it we ran into the customer service experience from hell. The only way we could return it and not lose out on the holiday savings (30% off and $20 Kohl's cash) was if we could swap it for ONE other item of our \"choosing\" that was EXACTLY $99.00 (not a penny more or a penny less). After an hour of not finding ANY other item that didn't end in .99, we gave up. The short, angry, brunette customer service lady with glasses (yes I'm talking about you! :-p) actually tried to give me $32 in store credit for something I had a receipt for $55 for. I told her that didn't even make sense. We'd found a $99.99 comforter my wife liked, but the customer service lady refused to allow me to buy more merchandise to cover any difference, so I had her put the $55 back on my credit card. She told me this also voided the $20 Kohl's cash I had in my wallet. So instead of having a cool gift for my wife and $20 store credit, I ended up wasting an hour shopping for a $99.00 gift that didn't exist, losing my 30% coupon, and losing the $20 Kohl's cash. Needless to say I'll be canceling my Kohl's card, and taking my business online. I so loved Kohl's for the past 15 years, but the shopping buzz does not abide scandalous fine prints on return policies. Farewell Kohl's. It's been a fun ride.

This Kohl's needs to have a meeting with their employee's.  I went shopping for shoes at quite a few different locations recently.  Stopped in for a look and could not find my size 13 anywhere.  None stocked, which is ok but when asking an older gentlemen with a mustache that worked their for some help, his English wasn't so great.  Asked him if they had any size 13's in the back and he said \"No, whats out is out\".  Although later I found out from another employee that they did have shoes in the back.\n\nUpon leaving I found a shirt I liked and got in line. This is where it got ridiculously confusing.  So your in line and there are a few people in front of you.  You would think there would be a few cash registers open at the checkouts.  Well there was One at the checkout, one at the jewelry, and two at the exchange or return registers calling out to people from far far away.  The one at the Regular register got a customer who was two places in front of me that insisted she was a discount on her phone but could not find it.  She was there so long the woman behind me starting arguing with her understandably because we were standing in line already for 8-10 minutes waiting.  The person in front of me went to the jewelry counter and was having issues there as well for whatever reason.  While the return registers (one with a manager) were calling a few people to them.  People just coming in the store went straight to the return/exchange registers by passing everyone else that had been waiting now for about 15 minutes and were getting service before the rest of us.  Needless to say, everyone was getting pissed.  Now you have people in line arguing with customers that are just coming in and the person STILL in the regular checkout.  Took the manager forever to finally come over and deal with the regular register person.  I finally get called to one of the checkouts at the return/exchange register and the woman that called me tries to stop me for a second to let a person that just came into the store do their exchange first, talking to the woman as if I had just cut her off \"Sorry I did not see you there, Ill be done with him (in a rolling the eye voice) in just a minute.    Seriously WTF. \n\n   It took almost 20 minutes in line to pay for items that originally only started with THREE PEOPLE in line and four checkouts! We ended up having over 12-14 people in line PO'd and Management did nothing to remedy the situation.  I know for a fact they could hear the people in line getting upset, swearing, saying this is unbelievable over and over again, etc.   Obviously Kohl's needs a new daytime manager.   Some tall skinny white guy on Monday the 4th of May if that helps if any District managers reading.

However, some stuff isn't cheap, like the Sketchers they have are much less at other places and even on the Sketchers website.  Kohl's has a great selection of clothes for adults and kids, and they may not be the BEST quality, but they are fairly trendy and not old people looking.  They have the usual cheesy department store jewelery selection for those with lots of love and a little cash.  The makeup selection looks decent and I've been told the Kohl's cosmetics and body stuff is good.  I haven't tried them.\n\nThe dressing rooms are spacious, you can take five things in.  I snuck in six.  Don't tell on me!  Every staff person I met was pleasant and helpful.  They seem to like working there, although it just opened.  Give it a few months, they'll be as cynical and disillusioned as the rest of us.\n\nI like the little half carts, but you would think they would make the aisles more than 1/2 inch wider than the carts, so when you are walking around while shopping the hangers of the clothes you put in the cart don't snag everything else along the way.  Maybe I'm just clumsy.  In fact, I know I am.   But the aisles should be wider, I'm just saying.\n\nFor 140 bucks I walked out with the jacket, three bras, a pair of isotoner slippers with little massagey arch inserts, a pair of pants, a shirt, and a little Halloween decoration for the front porch.

The entire mall needed to be evacuated for a noxious odor.  That wasn't my problem.  The Kohl's security manager was excellent.  He recognized that they would lose $1000s in sales and grabbed every employee that could run a register.  Smart move.  The front of the store was a different story.  I overheard the cashier manager (title?) say to several customers \"Just get out of the store\" and \"I don't care who you're waiting for, you need to get out\".  There are several different ways to say the same thing, just not as crude.  I was not impressed.\n\nMy next experience was no better.  While browsing, 2 associates were no more than 15 ft from me carrying on a conversation about their loathing for customers and how they \"can't wait to find another job\".  Not the best conversation to be having in front of customers.  Fortunately I'm a little more lax that most.\n\nI realize every big retailer faces these problems and turnover will always be an issue. But who is responsible for the morale of the associates?  That morale transfers the the customers and will gradually develop a poor taste in the mouths of the very people who keep you in business.  \n\nSomebody needs to keep an eye on these problems before things go downhill quickly.

My visit, today September 1,2015, was terrible. YET, they are remodeling and somewhat TRYING, that's why the Stoughton location deserves 2 stars (instead of one, which I posted 2 years ago). My cashier, Cindy (who was technically just at the return desk, but at other Kohl's they can do checkout if the checkout line is long), was very friendly and funny. Yet, the checkout area did not have a setup line area like I prefer (why is that the Milford store is the ONLY one to have an actual line!). Also, I just recently shopped the Milford Kohl's (on August 26,2015), and went to a price scanner and needed assistance. Keep in mind, at this store all of the price scanners WORK. Check the picture I posted, there were multiple scanners not working and I pressed the button on one to get customer service. No one showed up for 5 minutes. The loudspeaker kept saying \"Housewares please\". Yet no one still came. The store also didn't have very good shopping carts (in comparison to the ones at other Kohl's stores), and didn't have up many signs for prices. Basically everything I wanted to buy I had to bring to the one price scanner that actually worked. It was in the Home area. And everything came, which was nice, yet expected, since the regular prices seemed much higher than the prices I pay for items in the other stores (I normally visit Walpole and Milford). \nOverall, ok in a pinch, or to use Kohl's cash, and may be MUCH better once this ANNOYING renovation is over, yet for me this is just as far as the Milford store on Rt. 109, which is just SO much better.

I'd seen the circulars and the junk mail glossies, and noted that, in addition to their mainstay of apparel, they sell housewares.  The glossies had always been enticing.  Finally, I bit.\n\nI was on a quest for an 8\" skillet to replace one that met an untimely demise earlier in the day.  This was my last comparison shop before purchase, and I'd already been to the nearby BB&B, Target, and Wal-Mart to sample their wares.  I very much had in mind to either get an inexpensive good basic PTFE skillet or one of the new \"green\" skillets (my preference).\n\nAt first blush, the store reminded me of one of my favorite places, the late Mervyn's (of California).  Quickly glancing about I noted that the store was relatively neat and clean for 6 PM on a Saturday, and they seemed to have a good selection of clothing with some possible bargains.\n\nThat was just the demo, as they say.  I found that, at least with respect to kitchenware, Kohl's is a duck out of water.  The cookware section made me feel claustrophobic, and, although several \"sale\" signs were posted, I couldn't see any real values.  In fact, their open stock was limited to essentially TFAL (never again), Farberware (never, never again), and Food Network.  Yes, they made a half-hearted attempt to have some KitchenAid and some Calphalon, but they obviously weren't mainstays.\n\nProminently displayed were selections from Food Network.  No, I do not need a $50 8\" saute pan, thank you very much.  I happened to notice a Paula Deen cookware set on sale, identical to the one seen at Wally World a few minutes earlier.  Needless to say, Wally World's everyday price was about $30 less than Kohl's \"sale price\".\n\nAs I was still pretending to shop, I overheard a \"no worries\" return policy over the store music-come-gimmick sound system.  At least it sounds friendly enough.  Now, if they could only make a convincing argument to make me want to buy something, maybe I could test that out.\n\nOddly, although I'd found \"green\" pans at Target and BB&B, this was a foreign concept to Kohl's.  I left empty-handed, and wound up later purchasing an original Green Pan at Target.  I guess Kohl's merchandisers haven't kept up with the latest cookware trends for the past couple of years.\n\nMaybe someday I'll come back and look at the clothing.

Boo.\n\nPros:\n+ Sort of a department store feel (large, lots of stuff including housewares) without having to deal with the mall\n+ ample parking\n+ there is ALWAYS a sale of some sort going on.  Unless you really can't live without an item, go back in a week or two and it will be 30 - 50% off.  I swear -- it seems half the store is always at least 30% off.  Which makes me wonder why I should ever pay full price for something there.  I guess if you need something right away.\n+ lots and lots of accessories!  purses, sunglasses and jewelry galore!  not always great ones, but a lot to look through.\n\nCons:\n- Clearance racks are a mess.  I love shopping sale/clearance racks but it is near impossible here.  Not organized by style, size, anything as far as I can tell.  You've got to hunt for it.  And the racks are soooooo crammed, it's impossible to really flip through them.\n- Dressing rooms are always a mess.  Kohl's nicely puts racks outside the dressing rooms but they are always overflowing so people always leave the hooks in the dressing rooms over flowing as well.  a big BOO to that!\n- Shoe selection is disappointing.  And a mess.  The few times I have found semi-cute shoes there, trying to find the boxes that go with the display shoe is impossible.\n\nI still have some encouragement from my one fortuitous trip, but really, I doubt I will go back to Kohl's soon or even that often.  If I'm in a crazy shopping mood, I'll probably stop by -- mostly because it's easy to get in and out of which is its biggest plus.  And I hate paying full price and it's pretty easy to not do that here.", "date": "2007-07-24 16:16:33"}, {"review_id": "EAO9mYcmeM8LO91qzauVgQ", "user_id": "GEiXVDBNp7wNpjYz7TXCCQ", "business_id": "vk_EaNxzblZgrkL0KBQwFA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love Kohls, they have a good variety of clothes at very decent prices, and the sales are hard to beat. The clothes they have are really nice and of fairly goof quality. I have clothes I have bought there a few years ago and they are still in great condition. I am a big fan of shopping here, you can get a lot for less and the clothes are nice, in styles and good quality. I also like that they are open late. I have some anxiety disorders due to a car accident so I am not a fan of being in a store when it is busy. I have never had a bad experience with the people who work there, they are all nice and helpful. One downside is that they only have a few check out lines so it can get frustrating if you have to wait, even later. I also wish they had a better shoe selection, it is a hit or miss. I cannot really wear heals so I have to go with flats and the selections are really there, If you love boots and heals you will be happy. They also have bags, jewelry, home and house decor, so this is a pretty good place to shop for just about anything.  I haven't shopped in their home section often so I can't really say how the variety is there, but from what I have seen it seems like they have a lot. The jewelry is unbeatable, they always have sales going on there, and I have gotten some pretty cool stuff. It has always been clean, sometimes the clearance and sales racks can get messy but I think that is to be expected, not that big of a deal, still easy to look through and also it would be hard to keep up with that everytime a customer goes through it and drops stuff (people can be very careless and rude), so that is not somthing I blame on the employees.

Well I was accused of stealing but the young lady believed I had forgotten so they did not call the police, or ban me from the store. I was not allowed to pay for the items.

However, it will depend on the season as to if they'll have something of value to us in stock.  Some days I'll go in and find a super cute almost retro style top or dress- but then about three months later, I'll find the most drab kind of grandma-esque clothing.\n\n-They have a great home decor area with plenty of items that'll help your spruce up that bathroom or bedroom area.\n\n-We've also picked up luggage for a great price here.

Again, the item was a piece of cookware, one that I had seen on their website.  I hadn't checked to see if it was available in-store as open stock.  It wasn't, but it was on display as part of a set, so at least I got to inspect the item.\n\nLuckily, there was another similar piece I also had interest in that was available as open-stock, but the price posted was 100% more than I had verified was the \"manufacturer's suggested retail price\".  Yes, twice as much.  I wanted to see if Kohl's would match the MSRP, but I couldn't find any associate in the department to ask.  I went to the customer service desk, only to find the lone associate trying to convince a customer why they should get less money on a returned item than they originally paid for it.  Since that wasn't a good omen, I left the store anticipating the reaction I would get to my question.\n\nOnce home, I went online to Kohl's website to ask customer service for a price match.  I received a reply Friday indicating they did not understand my question and asking me to call for further assistance.  I placed that call Saturday morning.\n\nWhat ensued was nearly 35 minutes of sheer torture.  The customer service representative's skills were abysmal.  There were frequent 4-5 minute intervals of silence.  He ultimately made a competitive offer for the item, but he left me so frustrated that I eventually told him that I would not buy the item from Kohl's even if he offered it to me for free.  After more pleading from the CSR to buy, we had to have the conversation about the meaning of \"NO\".  Still, he did not relent.  Eventually, I hung up as he refused to release the call to the survey no less than 10 times.\n\nIn summary:\n- Customers should be aware that Kohl's regular prices can be double MSRP;\n- There is no customer service available in-store, only customer neglect/abuse;\n- The same markups (which I consider price gouging) exist on Kohl's website;\n- There is no reasonable customer service available from the corporate office.\n\nIn summary, Kohl's is the place to shop for people who are bad at managing their money, don't know how to comparison shop, and who enjoy pathetic customer service.

There are so many things to write about.having said that, I am basing my review on the clothes and the clothes selection. I don't shop here very often. Maybe 2-4 times a year. I usually purchase a lot of clothes at once and don't have the need to go back often. I come to Kohl's for the clothes and the prices. I have not purchased anything in the home goods, shoe, or jewelry department. The place can get messy. But that is true about most department stores that attract teens. The junior section is always a mess. Nothing is in order. Clothes are placed in the wrong area, unfolded, thrown about, room in the area looks like a tornado came through. BUT....I like the selection of clothes, the prices and quality, for the most part. They are always having a sale. Plus you find coupons in the mail and your email. I am talking about the junior section here. Things are a little cheaper in this area. When you are shopping in this section, check the size on the clothes bc they never match what the size says on the hanger. You can blame the customers for this. Trying on clothes and placing them back on the wrong hangers. \nOn to the adult section of clothes. I find nice tops and pants for work in this section. They have Simply Vera Wang ad Jennifer Lopez brands here. They are affordable and look decent for work clothes. This section is more kept up. But,  you have adults who are more reasonable than teens and they put things back where they should be and don't throw things around. I always change in the dressing rooms in this section. They are cleaner, nicer and less crowded. The section for clothes is large for adult women than the juniors section and I can find more items for myself. \nAs for the customer service, my cashier has always been friendly. I have noticed the same two ladies working here for the past two years. Both are nice and talkative and don't make you feel rushed and just try to push you out of the store. \nI will continue to shop here for my clothing needs in the future.

Deanna was smart enough( sarcasm)  to realize she was in the wrong and decided let me return it for my full refund. She asked if I wanted her to go out the back and find another one for me to exchange and I told her a resounding NO! I just want my refund and after I received it I walked away while she was still talking to me. I don't know how on Gods given Earth Kohls employs really inept, remedial, disrespectful and classless employees to represent their company which isn't doing too good I might add. I don't want to play the race card here but I noticed she was very polite and prompt with a white ladies return seconds before me. When she seen me, her demeanor changed. I'm a person of color and proud so wether she in fact is racist or just a big A hole she doesn't deserve to be employed by Kohl's. I will definitely be taking this to corporate and I hope this lady gets fired. You guys lost me as a longtime loyal customer. I will be telling everyone I know of the racist encounter I had today at the garbage Medford Kohl's. Never will you see another cent from me again, or from family and friends.

I was interested in seeing a few watched that they had behind the counter. I walked along the counter and stopped where the watches were located.

Again NO! one asked me if I needed help. I would this considering I'm the customer that someone out of the 3 would have assisted me. Surely management would be disappointed to hear that a customer was being ignored while visiting their store. So after standing there for 5min I decided to leave, but not without talking to the manager. I went up to a cashier whom by the way was very polite. I asked her for the manager on duty. She told me that the person who is the acting manager is Alex, so I asked to speak to her. The cashier told me that she, the manager was at the jewelry counter. So to my surprise one of the 3 women standing at the jewelry counter that I just left from because I was being ignored is the acting manager!!  Well no wonder why the other 2 didn't acknowledge me they're learning from Their boss. Anyway, Alex had the nerve to ask the cashier what was wrong and of course by this time I'm hot. I ask the cashier for Alex boss name, Alex told her over the phone (still standing at the jewelry counter) the boss name (Ruby) and that Ruby will be in tomorrow not sure of the time. This entire time Alex is talking on the phone to the cashier that she could clearly see from the jewelry counter and seen me standing there. She Not once came over to find out what the problem was instead she decided to talk to me through the cashier.  I just have to say.

Customer service and the technology that supports them is so backwards.\n\nHere are the 100 excruciating steps to buying a TV a Kohl's\n\n1. Recieved a large gift card at work for Kohl's... most painful gift to actually utilize ever.\n2. Kohl's delivered me ten 100 dollar gift cards.\n3. Kohl's.com only accepts 4 forms of payment online ( TV i want costs 700)\n4. TV's are only sold online.... are we seeing the problem...\n5. I still love Kohls at this point. A quick call to the help line will fix it? No. They tell me to go to the store and they can merge gift cards.\n6. The store (1 hour away) says they have no idea how to merge cards\n7. They make me call the customer service line.\n8. The customer service line tells me the store can do it.\n9. I let the customer service and store talk.\n10. I then ask can I just buy a huge item in store with ten gift cards and get a refund on one card? (I had asked this earlier but they turned it down at first, but it seemed to make perfect sense so I asked again)\n11. They finally say yes to merging cards via my suggested method.\n12. We merge the gift cards.\n13. I buy the TV!\n14. The TV is delivered damaged a week and a half later after 3 hours with customer service, and an hour in the store...\n15. I call to return the TV, and this process is even more loopy.\n16. They do not give you the postage label. UPS brings it. (Preventing me from just bringing it to a UPS store) I ask if I can schedule when UPS comes to pick the TV up. Kohls says you can't schedule it.\n17. I wait at my door each day during normal UPS hours since you can't just leave a huge TV outside your door step\n18. Finally, they take my TV back.\n19. I call Kohls and ask if they can send a new TV\n20. Kohls says they have to mail me a new gift card...\n21. I go, \"can't you just not mail it and just order me it over the phone?\"\n22. They say no. I say, \"just pretend you mailed it and type in the gift card number now...\" still no.\n23. The gift card arrives two weeks later\n24. The gift card is for 140 less than the value of the TV.\n25. I call Kohl's. They say I received Kohl's Cash for buying TV and they can't refund me the full amount. (mind you Kohl's Cash is promotional money only valid for a short time period... it's not really money) Gift cards always represent real money... This intuitively is not fair, but let's play Kohl's game for a second... \n26. I say you can invalidate the Kohl's Cash from this purchase, but I don't want to spend my own money to make up the difference to be able to purchase the TV then receive Kohl's cash and be forced to buy something else from your horrible store!\n27. It's been a month since I got my broken TV. I just want a TV. I miss Amazon. I miss logical processes at companies... \n\nLong story short: Other reviewers mention how the store is disorganized.

I do not shop at most stores most people love - I loathe Costco, target, Macy's, wal-anything and shopping malls.  I'm a member of more than one country club, my suits are made to order and I mostly shop at small local shops and Mario's downtown. \n\n3rd - I'm not going to apologize for it.  I worked hard for my money and I appreciate the things it does for me and if you're too insecure to deal with it, then Skippy, that's your problem.  Now, while I will spend a lot of money on something, I still have more taste than money and because I worked hard for it, I'm not going to waste my money on a label or a name or because someone says it's cool. \n\nHaving said that, I've only been to this Kohl's once and I think the 1 other review is terribly unfair and out of order entirely.  I would probably never buy clothes at Kohl's, and you'd have to put a bullet in my brain to get me into a target for anything, but when it comes to kitchen basics, bed and bath basics, house wares - this place is worth going into.\n\nI hate Macy's for one main reason - horrible customer service.  While I may have 'lower standards' for service at Kohl's, truthfully I find I like shopping better without the hovering sales person kissing my backside.  Kohl's return policy (which I did use at Gateway on a defective product) is outstanding and the customer service we received at that store while doing a return was, bar none, better than I have EVER received at Macy's on a purchase.  (I've never tried to return anything at a Macy's but I cannot imagine the service is better when I'm taking, rather than giving, money)\n\nI do shop about once a month at the Kohl's near my office in Beaverton.  It lacks the throngs of slack-jawed dirty shoppers and their sprog at the near by Target - I credit that to the no craptacular food court or food products at Kohl's, and possibly the lack of tacky neon orange and floods of Television adverts pointed squarely at the lowest common denominator who are easily distracted by a shiny objects or the occasional stick.\n\nAs for the other review - hurrah - yes indeed, I believe Target is famed for its feng shui and many of the words you used do sound very close to the correct word you were stabbity stabbity trying to employ.

Lately, not so much. There are apparent theft and car break-ins going on at this location so I'm sure their focus has shifted (and boy have I felt it the past few times I've stopped in). Kohls is one of those places where I like to shop around and look in different sections because it's really like a mall to me. They have shoes, clothes, jewelry, workout gear for decent prices... but I've noticed lately that when I go shopping by myself, other people have been joining me every time I begin to meander. I don't even like wearing purses or carrying bags so I really wouldn't have a place to put anything, so I'm going to go with the fact that I don't fit the mold of a \"proper\" shopper (assume what you will with that). \n\nThere's a guy walking around on his cell phone corresponding with someone who is in the back watching on the cameras and tells him where to go. How do I know this? ... because he asked \"where did she go\" and then turned around and I was the only one there. I thought I was just overreacting the past few times so I ignored it, but I already knew their faces this time because they busted someone else stealing right when I got there. So, I'm deciding to write a review about the pros and cons:\n\nPros: Prices are decent (but I think they have been or are rising due to theft) and decent selection of items, Kohls cash given if you spend over a certain amount. \n\nCons: Cashiers are nice but not well trained to answer any questions besides signing up for a Kohls (credit) card, if you're a minority prepared to be watched and followed until you check out, use your kohls cash before the expiration or else they will give you shit for telling them that the previous manager told you to disregard the expiration date (I know this isn't standard but I promise you this is true and have redeemed plenty of expired ones before), I signed up to get rewards 4 times and I'm still not a rewards member (can security track down where my personal information went??), don't park in between big cars or in the dark areas of the parking lot. \n\nI probably added fuel to the fire by actually supporting their business anyways and ended up spending over $115 (you're welcome)... I hope no one was stealing during this time while you guys were wasting your \"skills\" and were busy watching me because yes, minorities help contribute to funding your paychecks too. 2 stars for the good selection in store.

With that in mind, it would be very optimistic for me to say that this store has aged better than Mark Hamill.\n\nI used to really like Kohl's. Their discounts seemed to painlessly assemble so that you were always pleasantly surprised at checkout. Discounts just showed up like blackberry roots. \n\nToday' experience is slightly different. I mean, you do still get a surprise at checkout. But instead of berries, you just get the pricks. \n\nWhat was $7.99 per the signage on the rack *poof!* turns into 11.99 at the register. What was $21.99 on the rack *poof!* turns into $28.99 at the register. It is almost like magic. Not so much \"rainbow-y unicorn-y magic\", though. More like an Avada Kedavra for your wallet. \n\nThe displays this time were horrible. What a mess. Packages had been sitting there opened for who knows how long, with contents strewn about. And every size mixed in with every other size, and all of the different styles mixed together, just to make it more fun. What a waste of time to go through each item one by one, moving the mess to look under it- all just to see if they even had what I needed. I found Hoffa and Sasquatch before finding what I needed.\n\nBut when I found it- hey! It was buy one, get one half price!\nOh, until I got to the register and \"Avada Kedavra!\" *poof!* \nNow it is full price- plus that full price is a dollar higher than what was stated on the rack. \n\nSo based on the rack pricing, I expected my purchases to be one amount. But the amount that came up on the register was 141.6% higher than I expected. \n\nNow I don't want to sound like a slacker, but there are a few times in life when you should not give 141.6%. Giving blood is one of those times. And I really think that this would be another. \n\nAnd yes- of course, the lady at the counter told me she could send someone to check on the price. But you see, I already spent 141.6% of the time I had allotted for my trip to this store on digging through their package mess. \n\nMy understanding is that Kohls *just* spent 18 months trying to re-invent themselves and that their turnaround plan only produced marginal results. They keep talking about their store brand, Sonoma. Seriously?? Who cares? They are way out of touch with their customers. \n\nLook at the trend of Kohl's complaints in any consumer discussion board. Complaint after complaint says nothing about their store brand. It is always about the various ways that a customer was gouged at payment. And the next biggest complaint is always about the shopper experiences: How were they treated? Were their intended purchases accessible and presentable?\n\nBut nothing puts you more out of touch with your customers than closing shop completely, I suppose. Kohl's announced today that it is closing 18 under-performing stores. Kind of stretching the definition of \"reinvention\" if you ask me. Personally, when I look on my receipt, I don't look for \"fewer stores\" and \"Sonoma\".", "date": "2016-03-18 23:35:58"}, {"review_id": "dUfkEB4rZKkKiahV9xMGIQ", "user_id": "FqmC5kZevT-qBDf0gUMUug", "business_id": "w8p9L1tRNlL_NF3NDk8omg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Kohl's violated ADA in a recent interaction with them (Alfred, 0452) and should be avoided in my opinion.", "date": "2019-12-24 20:08:34"}, {"review_id": "1X9tRESJe3JjDU0eudIHHA", "user_id": "b88ODsG4-9TlTk6GzHp_Wg", "business_id": "w8p9L1tRNlL_NF3NDk8omg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I hate kohl's every time I go.

There is a massive private parking lot and access from High Street/ 23 was very easy. \n\nUpon entering the store, the carts were orderly and there appeared to be several registers open.  Once you go a bit deeper into the store, you see what a true disaster it is.  None of the kiosks are in order and the racks are even worse. I walked over to a rack and noticed there were tons of clothes shoved underneath it, and they weren't even from the men's department.  A store employee was opening and refolding shirts on a display which seemed to be in great shape compared to the rest of the store, yet ignored all the clothes littered on the floor.  There were boxes on the floor of the shoe department with no shoes in them, and a display in a central aisle sat empty. \n\nI was actually able to find a pair of pants that fit me after a ton of digging but the little display screen with the price was turned off.  I asked the closest employee and she told me to walk to the back of the store to find the device where you can scan a tag to find its price.  I found the device and it also wasn't working.  I hit the button for help (another customer was also trying to use it to no avail), and the 2 employees who responded stated they didn't have walkies or Bluebirds (I believe that's the term the used), so they couldn't scan items for us, so we'd have to ask someone at a register or use the price scanner.  Yep, the employees noticed it was broken, but their solution was to tell us to use the broken scanner.  How does that even make sense? They walked away and the other customer figured out how to reset it to get it working.  Takes the term self-service to the next level. \n\nI finally was ready to check out and the woman was training another individual.

My wife had gone to the store to return a coat I had purchased from the clearance rack, after trying it on I accidentally grabbed the wrong size and purchased it. \n\nMy wife went last night to try and exchange it, she went back to the rack and grabbed what she thought was the correct one as well as an additional winter coat that was on the clearance rack that was not labelled. When she went to customer service, she was met by an Customer Service Associate named \"Deborah\" (No last name but grayish hair and name tag said she had been there since 2014)  who was extremely rude and condescending to her their entire encounter. Deborah was apparently upset that my wife asked her what the clearance price was on the additional winter coat from the clearance rack, Deborah scolded her and said \"THIS coat wasn't on sale, there is NO WAY this was on the clearance rack where did you really get it?\" in effect she was accusing my wife of  lying to her over something that may of probably just been misplaced inventory. My wife politely told her it WAS on the clearance rack and that she wasn't interested in that coat at full price.\n\nMy wife, Melissa, moved on the exchange transaction. When she handed the coat to be exchanged to Deborah, who stated \"What have you done to that coat?! You have obviously been wearing it.\" In all honesty, the coat was taken home and tried on one time which it didn't fit around me -I literally could have ripped it if I stretched my shoulders. All the tags, both Kohl's purchase tags and the Chaps manufacturer tags, were still attached to the arm and lapel. When my wife pointed that out Deborah she incredulous, and she said \"You must be a smoker, and worn it while smoking because you got ashes all over the coat -I can't accept this -it's damaged\" (neither my wife or I are smokers, and when Melissa told her this Deborah didn't believe her and scoffed) my wife was very upset and embarrassed by this time, and offered to take the coat and leave... she specifically said that she would come back when there was someone else to assist her.\n\nWhen Deborah heard this she said that SHE was trying to assist her and asked my wife for the new coat that we wanted to exchange for the small one. Deborah stated \"Can't you tell this isn't even the same coat; it's not even the same material -you can't tell that?\" to further degrade my wife. At which point my wife asked for the coat back and started to leave when Deborah said that she would refund the original coat and asked for the receipt -which was linked to my Wife's reward account. When Melissa told her this Deborah said \"you don't even have the receipt?!\" and began arguing with my wife about whether it could be returned using the Rewards account number, which we had done in the past. Eventually one of the other nearby Customer Service Agents told Deborah \"Yes you can do that\" and educated Deborah on how.\n\nI am sorry I don't have all the complete details about the encounter but I wasn't present. I will say that for my wife to say we are never shopping at Kohl's again it had to be pretty bad.  We were so happy when that store opened in Grove City and have been shopping there ever since, it's where we basically buy all our clothing for our family of 5. I know that the loss of our spending would never impact anything  to a big company, but I wanted to take the time to let you know about the event and make you aware of how this Sales Associate is treating people who have issue or returns of products.

Kohl's is awesome if you want to save money on clothes and shoes, but you need to make sure that you have three things: a Kohl's credit card, coupons and their rewards card. It possible to find great deals without, but they really give back to people that invest completely in their business model. They're constantly running BOGO sales, clearances, and percent off sales. One of the best things is Kohl's cash. When you spend money, you get a rebate (like a gift card) that you can use like cash on your next visit. It's a great way to save money and really get the things you need. My wife and I buy almost all of our work attire and summer attire her; heck, we buy almost all of our clothes here.

We found some bedding that we like and when we got it home (an hour drive back) we opened it up and found out that it was missing the pillow cases. It was an expensive bedding set and we wanted our money's worth, my husband called Kohls customer service and was given attitude from the girl on the phone who reacted like he was stupid for asking about a solution and she told him he had to make the trip back to exchange the product. Instead of driving out to the same Kohls, we instead went to the Hillsboro Kohls (much closer to us). They did not have the product in stock and provided ABSOLUTELY no solution, our option was to find a different bedding set that was the exact same original price so we could keep our discounts and kohls cash we used on the original purchase. Instead of trying to find a solution like having another store with the product in stock send us the replacement, she told us we could go to Beaverton and get a replacement there. \n\nSo my husband and I had to drive all the way back to the original store for a replacement. When we got there, the customer service clerk was a young man, named Anthony, who did not provide ANY greeting whatsoever or apology for the hassle. He mumbled at us and had a overall bad attitude. He told us we could go get our replacement product and bring it back to make the exchange. When we got back, he was not at his station,but was ineffectively helping a woman at the registry machine. It was clear he was firing a very poor job of helping her. He saw us waiting but instead of saying \"I'm sorry I will be with you shortly\" or \"you could try a different register, this will be awhile\" he let us stand there waiting for at least 15 minutes. Eventually he came back and my husband placed the new product on the counter and the clerk held out his hand for the receipt, he did not ask for the receipt, just held out his hand. He then got a call on his radio about the issue with the woman at the registry machine. Instead of saying \"excuse me one minute\" he barely mumbled \"give me a minute I have to deal with this or I will forget...\" He then managed to finish our return but didn't take the security tag off so my husband had to ask him to. The clerk handed us the receipt and walked away without a \"thanks for shopping,\" \"sorry for the trouble,\" or even \"have a good night.\" He also did not check the product to make sure everything was included so we wouldn't have same problem again. We did this ourselves before leaving so we would not have to make another return trip.\n\nI was extremely unsatisfied with Kohls' customer service and the entire experience.

It seems like the music isn't on very much of the time, which surprisingly can really affect a person's comfort when shopping there.

Fortunately, it's nearby, which is another way of saying that it's convenient for me. That makes a big difference for a busy guy like me, so I'm going to make a big deal about it. I'm allowed, it's my review!\n\nA wonderful attribute about Kohl's is their vast selection of goods. Here's a list of what they have to offer: clothing (women's, juniors', intimates (my favorite!), men's (my second favorite), young men's, kids' & babies'), toys, shoes, jewelry, beauty, bed & bath, kitchen & dining, furniture & home decor, home care, luggage & backpacks, electronics & games and (my absolute favorite) - clearance. Now, that's selection. Don't you agree?\n\nWhat's \"selection\" without good pricing? Nothing. You're right. Kohl's isn't Walmart when it comes to rock-bottom pricing, but they are a very close second. Plus, they have a much better clothing selection than Walmart, so there's really no comparison when it comes to fine threads. Who goes to Walmart for clothes anyway? Well, maybe kids, but that's where I draw the line.\n\nThe customer service at Kohl's is second to none. They never give you a hard time when it comes to returns or exchanges. They really want your business and they prove it through their actions. I really enjoy happy people when I shop. It makes the difference for me, especially if I'm not in the best mood myself.

You can stock up on shirts here, as well as shorts and workout cloths. \n\nOf course, it's buy what you get-- meaning they don't do adjustments.

There was a \"buy one and get the second for half price\" deal; the customer service employees in the Walpole store, once I showed them the sales receipt for the first suitcase I had just bought in the Burlington store, immediately allowed me to buy the second suitcase for half price with no hassle. That by itself was a pleasant surprise.\nNow fast forward to today. My husband and I took these two suitcases on a 19 day trip to South America. We got back only a couple of days ago with the two suitcases, both of which had significant tears in the fabric at the edges of the suitcases; this is clearly a defect as no suitcase should be deteriorating that quickly. One suitcase also had a hard piece of metal or plastic beginning to stick out at the top edge. I brought them back to Kohl's with the sales slip in hand, showing that the suitcases were less than a month old. With no hassle at all, they refunded the cost of the two suitcases and were extremely pleasant.

This location in particular is awful. It is dirty, clothes are unfolded and on the floor and the staff is uncaring and unhelpful.

Each time, I have gone first thing in the morning when the store opened at 7:00am to pick up. Each time, I was the only car in the parking lot and I believe the only customer in the store. Each time, I was waited on by \"Peggy\" at customer service.  Peggy has completely ruined my day all three times. She has no idea how to do a \"online order\". Worst of all, I once asked her when I would receive my \"Kohl's Cash\" for a previous large purchase she she cut me off and said she has \"nothing to do with that\" and I needed to CALL customer service. I was STANDING AT CUSTOMER SERVICE! So I went out to my car, called customer service, spoke with a lovely non-English speaking gentleman, and he emailed me my $30 from a previous large purchase. He instructed me to go in the store and return my latest purchase and re-buy it with the Kohl's Cash. Once again, I was waited in by Peggy at the Customer Service desk and she was now extremely rude. I explained in a friendly manner that I had just called, blah blah blah and wanted to return and re-purchase my recent purchased items. She huffed and puffed and said \"well I hope you have everything ready and your email all set because I am very busy and have customers waiting\". Again, it was no 7:20am, I was still the only car in the parking lot and there was NO ONE in the store. Peggy does her thing and when it came time to scan my emailed Kohl's cash I had to unlock my phone (takes 2 seconds). While my fingers were moving Peggy snorted at me AGAIN and said \"I told you to have everything ready Im busy\". I wanted to walk away and leave. Seeing as though it was Christmas gifts I needed I couldn't. I went home and tried to call/email/smoke signal to Kohl's Corporate Customer Service and received a petty email back that my issue was being looked into and I would be contacted.

On 8/11/16 we shopped for back to school clothes for my son. The store itself was in disarray even though it was not very busy. There was some sort of painting or renovation going on that made it quite difficult to shop in several depts. Nonetheless, we completed our shopping for the most part and while checking out the power went out suddenly. The registers stayed on and appeared to be fully functioning. In fact, two of the other cashiers continued checking out their guests. Our cashier insisted that she had to void our order and we would have to come back to pick it up. Understanding that this is probably a new situation, I obliged. My tow boys and I went to wait near the exit for the rain to lighten. As we did my son pointed out that there were now 3 registers ringing people out. I went back to the register and asked Diane, our cashier, to please retrieve our items so that we too could be checked out. She stated that she was quite tired and asked my son to go retrieve the items (mind you the store is still dark and customers are not supposed to be in the store at this point per the repeated announcements). He retrieved our items from the service desk and Diane begins ringing again only to have an issue with the \"system\" now. She informs me after calling \"E3 Kristie\" to help that I will indeed have to return the next day. We are now 1 hour into trying to check out, meanwhile at least a dozen other guests were successfully checked out at 3 other bays. \n\nI explained this frustration to Kristie and she asked if any \"concession\" would be offered if I returned for my items on 8/12/16. She told Diane to write down that she would give us 50% off our total. I told her I certainly didn't expect that, I was thinking 10%, but that I appreciated it greatly! Kristie stated that I could go to the service desk and they would have my items and check me out. At no time did she suggest another register, just that the hold was the only option. \n\nOn 8/12/16 I went at lunch to pay for our items. I was told by service desk clerk that I needed to go back to registers to pay. So, another line. I explained the cashier the situation and showed her the WRITTEN note that stated we were to have 50% off our order. She called \"E3 Lisa\" and Lisa came to the register. She stated that if I wanted 50% off, it would be off the original price (over half of the items we were purchasing were clearance and therefore that would cause me to pay MORE than I would have yesterday). I showed her the written note and she stated that \"Kristie shouldn't have offered that and the best she would offer was 30%\". Which is what I would have had anyway using my Kohl's charge and coupon. Lisa was contrite and unfriendly the entire conversation. In order to have my son's school clothes I agreed to her \"concession\" of no savings and checked out. As I was paying my son saw \"E3 Kristie\" there shopping and we watched her and Lisa speaking. After I completed my order, I walked over to them, hoping to find some resolution. Lisa rolled her eyes, ROLLED HER EYES, and walked away while I explained to Kristie the situation and she stated that \"she wasn't even working today\"  and that she was \"sorry about that\". She then turned around and walked away. \n\nThe lack of customer service and disrespectful treatment of these \"managers\" has ensured that we will not return to this Kohls. We will shop Beall's instead. Again, I wasn't expecting to be handed the moon here, I do however, expect to be treated fairly and respectfully. At no time was I loud, rude, or denying the difficulty of the unusual situation with the power outage.

Never. I've never seen a dirty dressing room, the restrooms are spotless, the staff bends over backwards to help if you look 'lost' or unable to decide on something. I read the reviews below and I was just shocked at how different your 'take' is from mine.  I find value in one aisle after the other and when they clearance something, it's an amazing reduction. As far as the woman who wrote in a bad review because the cashier didn't check her bag for a receipt, that was a little too much for me.  I think retail people are often treated like chattel (along with restaurant staffers) and this is just wrong all the way around. I am 100% sure that if the dust-bunny lady brought this issue to the store manager's attention he would have immediately removed them and apologized.  I use their dressing rooms all the time and in countless years never saw such a thing--but that doesn't mean it didn't happen so don't get all yelpy on me.  I don't think the \"jack up\" their prices to slap a sales sign on merchandise, either.  If you don't like real value and great things, there's always Marshall's and the like. At Kohl's you have a wonderful selection to choose from--at the other discounters it's like going to a table hungry and being fed others' pick-overs for the fourth time.  Kohl's is the company I keep, so what if there's an occasional unfolded turtle neck on a shelf?  Barcode problems are inherent in the retail industry; not just Kohl's. A SMART consumer watches at the check-out; I certainly do.  \n\nRecently some loser consumer took a Euphoria box and removed the cologne and REPLACED IT with an empty bottle of baby phat; the atomizer top didn't fit in the box so they tore the top of the bottle off to get the box to reclose. They then used a small piece of shiny cellophane tape to close it up--and they returned it to Kohl's for whatever reason.  The box was pristine--this was CLEARLY someone with misguided creativity. I BOUGHT THE COLOGNE and three days later I went to wear some and voila!  Screwed by a loser!  I called Calvin Klein in NYC thinking it was a manufacturing screw up. Nope. CK informed me this is a loser shoplifter trick.  I then called Kohl's and spoke with \"Erin\" at the Walpole Kohl's. SHE WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND to apologize for something that wasn't even a Kohl's mistake.  I returned it HANDING THE CLERK MY RECEIPT and I was provided a replacement AND an apology.  I think if Kohl's Walpole isn't meeting your standards you're probably a Neiman Marcus type because the Kohl's I shop is first-rate. I'm sorry the store didn't meet so many of your needs, I just can't imagine how this could be.

I shop at Kohl's and I love it.  What I love about it is that if you see something you like but don't feel like it's quite worth the price printed on the tag, you can wait a month or so and it'll most likely be 60% off or more.  The clearance racks are where it's at, with stuff routinely marked down to 80, even 90% off.  Granted, some of the clearance merchandise is stuff even my grandfather wouldn't wear, but if you have some patience you can find some great deals.  Maybe I just hit it at the right times, but the Danvers location seems to have way more clearance racks than any of the other stores in the area.  Saugus is good, too.  Yeah, maybe some of their clothes aren't of the highest quality, but if you get it dirt cheap, do you really care all that much?  Not me!  As far as non-clearance clothing, they are constantly having sales on basics like solid polos, underwear and socks, etc.  \n  \nI'm not sure how the selection is for the plus-sized ladies, but I wish Kohl's would expand into the realm of big and tall sizes for men.

When I brought it to this kohls in walpole the lady first was rude about telling me she was with someone else. I am very understanding and do not mind waiting but to be told nicely would have been much appreciated. Then when she finished with the other customer she came over to me. After I asked her to take a few links off she told me that they don't take links off this brand. I then told her that the women in Hingham told me they could. She continued to tell me they don't do any adjustments until January because it takes too much time during the holidays. If this is true it is a terrible rule because it does not take much time at all to remove links on a Sunday with minimal people in the store. Also as a valued repeating customer I would have liked a little more time and respect. She hurried me along and quickly crossed the counter to someone else.
