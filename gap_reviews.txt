We recently found another pair very similar at J.Crew and thought it made no sense to have two pair. That being said, I went to Atlantic Station to return the ones purchased. There was no wait in line so I thought this would be quick return. However, that was not the case.

I was caught off guard by this statement considering my wife just purchased the shoes two days ago.  Not to mention the shoes were still attached together making it impossible for them to be worn. He continued to point out that the shoes had a crease at the front and had been worn. Working in retail many years ago I know that shoes can sometimes get a crease at the toe from customers trying them on. I pointed out that the bottom of shoe was cleaned and showed no proof of being worn. However, he continued to accuse my wife of wearing the shoes and even made the remark \"Sir, you could have cleaned them off like some people\".

I visited this store several times in the mid to late 2000s, but I've rarely visited in the 2010s because I have all the clothes I need. However, I did find myself back here recently and the store was pretty much just as I remembered it. While the layout has changed over the years, the overall store design mostly remains the same. There haven't been any significant or major renovations.\n\nI like Gap jeans. They fit me well enough, the quality is good enough, they last a long time (many years), they're comfortable, and they're affordably priced. I'm a small guy and Gap carries men's jeans as small as a 28 waist and 28 length. However, most of the smaller (and bigger) sizes aren't carried in stores and must be ordered online. This is what I've had to do most of the time. I did find a particular pair of jeans in my size at the Gap store at Lenox Square years ago, but that was an anomaly.\n\nWhat I've normally ended up doing is ordering online, trying on at home, and returning what doesn't fit or what I don't like at this store in Atlantic Station (since I live in Atlantic Station, it's a very quick trip for me). The returns process has always been fast and easy.\n\nAt regular price, most of my jeans have cost about $50-70 each, but I've almost always purchased during a special sales offer or promotion or used a coupon. In the end, my jeans have worked out to more like $40 apiece, with free shipping too.\n\nI like the different cuts the jeans come in. For example, standard, straight, and slim. They also come in a variety of colors, washes, and styles. Over the past decade, I've opted for the simple darker washes. The color does transfer so you have to wash the jeans a few times which is annoying. It's important to note that not all of the same colors are created equally. For example, I tried on two \"indigo\" colored jeans, but one pair was noticeably darker than the other. So in actuality, colors between pairs can vary even though the labels might say they're the same color.\n\nI've also purchased a belt or two from this store. Like their jeans, Gap's belts last a long time too.\n\nMost, if not all, of the employees I've encountered at this store have been nice and helpful.\n\nPark in the Atlantic Station parking deck on level P2.

They were like goddamn bellbottoms for the 21st century metro. Current crush: Pants that fit over my rollerblades. Well, I should mention that I skated on in to this cathedral of style and did a spin and then I did a toe-grind across one of their clever displays and got a round of applause from the GAP staff. Standing O anyone? Can you say gold medal entrance? I fell on my rear end though. Nobody cared. But I got up and ordered some slacks!

IMHO the security guard was staring me down and hovering over me because he knew that I was a serious buyer. I am a whale. Had a dog named beans once. He was pretty cool.

Went there around 11 am on March 2nd,  2015. It was not busy.  Was expecting to get some help and none of the employees bothered greeting or acknowledging me.  I picked up 8 pairs of clothes and headed to the change room.  Nobody there.  I proceeded to help myself into the change room since I was in a rush.  Needed help with sizing but nobody there.  Ended up buying one item and it also felt like they were doing me a favor when I asked if the item was on sale.  Worse experience ever.

Sales guy walked right up to me, discussed my sizes, rounded up the 8 pairs that I would need to try on, plus a couple of other (smaller) sizes I assumed to make me feel good about myself. Well, it worked. I walked right into the dressing room, tried on the smaller sizes first (to get it out of the way), found that they fit, got final approval from the 4 yr old and we marched right out. Success!\n2) Holiday shopping. I walked in looking for ideas for a shirt or something for my husband and was told that I had 2 hours to enjoy 50% off in the store. Now, who does not feel good about that. I did find my husband a pretty decent shirt, but I ended up buying about $200 worth of clothes that I otherwise would not have spent...updated the work closet. Well done Gap - that's how you drive incremental sales. More importantly though, as I wandered around with the weight of my potentials on one arm, a lovely gentlemen scooped them up and set them up in a dressing room and told me to just go look for my name on the door when i was done browsing. This is definitely a new thing as far as i can remember. I then had a lovely girl chase down a couple of other sizes while i was trying things on. Typical for most shops, but she was Super helpful and fast. About an hour later, as I walked out, the original, helpful sales guy asked me by name if i found the trousers I needed. nice touch\n\nI don't care what anyone says, Gap is reliable and has decent quality clothes when you need those handy little somethings that are blue, brown, black or white.
