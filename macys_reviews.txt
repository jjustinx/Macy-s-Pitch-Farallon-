Sometimes I go in there briefly to pick-up replacements for my facial care and make-up products. \n\nBut there's a price to pay for this convenience.  As the store moves toward closing, let's say after 9 PM, you will have your own personal security person who stays in your vicinity.  They wear red shirts that say \"Security\", so it's hard to miss them.  And since there are fewer customers in the store after 9:00, there are enough security people to provide individualized attention.  \n\nThe security people are not trying to hide the fact that they're essentially stalking you.  Once, I saw one of them say something into his walkie-talkie as I opened an exit door.  I guess he was reporting that his assigned person had left the premises.  Maybe he needed a new person to stalk.........\n\nI'm African-American.  So this might be a simple offense of Shopping While Black.  Needless to say, I'm deeply offended.

I was in search of the nearest Fashion Fair counter and Google led me to Cumberland Mall. \n\nWhen I arrived to the cosmetics department, everything looked so nice. You know the usual cosmetic counter displays and such. However, it was my dismay to see the Fashion Fair cosmetics counter. First off I noticed an associate around for every makeup counter with the exception of FF. They counter for FF was a very small corner setup. I fumbled through the inventory trying to find a nude lipstick. I liked something that I could wear everyday when I'm casual. I also wanted some moisturizer for my sensitive skin. I read online that FF skin care line is non comedogenic. I was very interested in the product and looked around for someone to allow me to test it. \n\nFinally Tefta, the associate at the Clinique counter waled over with a beautiful smile and asked if I needed any help. I explained to her what I wanted and she rand over to the Clinique counter and grabbed tissue, alcohol and wooden sticks for me to try on cosmetics . I searched the the lipsticks and described the one I was looking for by name. She ran (literally running ) back to Clinique counter to look up the name for me on the web. She came back and showed me the lipstick from the inventory. She told me it was new from the box and I could not test it, but she wanted me to see the shade.\n\n Finally after dabbing around in FF with not FF rep, I went over to  the Clinique counter with, Tefta. I began to express to her my skin care needs and she sent me home with samples to try. She told me that she has the same problems I have and she described the symptoms perfectly. Then I felt I could relate to Tefta, although we are from different ethnicities , she made   feel comfortable because of her knowledge. She also explained the best shades of lipstick for me, based on my skin tone. \n\nAlthough I really wanted a rep from Fashion Fair cosmetics, Tefta made me feel better about my experience. It's pretty sad that Fashion Fair doesn't care enough to have someone consistently representing them. It doesn't mater whats going on behind the scenes of the business. Customers on social media talk so much about they way there isn't a rep at the FF counter. \n\nI will be purchasing the skin care from Clinique. I've been using the samples and they are working out great! Thank you Tefta, for your awesome customer service. You went over and beyond for me . Not once did you degrade the other company.

This kind young man patiently searched through various frames until he found one that fit my lenses just right. He even helped me save addition $$$ by suggesting I uses my AARP card. What a great guy! \n\nMouktier, reminded me, you can pay someone to work for you but never enough to give you their heart. They either have that capacity or not. Paying more for their heart only throws good money after bad. This fine gentleman puts his heart into helping you, the customer.

It's faster, more convenient, and eliminates the hassle of dealing with gifts on the wedding day.

The employee went to a kiosk and printed out the couples' entire registry for me.  It looked like a really long receipt.  I browsed through the near-overwhelming list and honed in on a handful of items.  The employee then accompanied me to the housewares department and I picked out a couple items to purchase.

It's a bit like stepping back in time to the 1950s as it is set up much more like a prim and proper department store of that era:  the departments are more physically separated and individually distinct and the clothes are much more spaced out on displays. It was also pretty deserted there: I only ran into about ten other shoppers in the hour or so that I was there. The first floor houses their women's shoe department, a small assortment of cosmetics counters and a small sock and hoisery department. I found some great socks on clearance but there is no cash register for the sock/hoisery department so I bounced back between the shoe department register (where there was a small group of old women lecturing each other on the virtues of buying their winter boots in March at 70% off... enjoy wearing them for a couple weeks) and the handbag department register (where a middle aged lady was taking advantage of a serious discount on a $300 bag). After buying my socks, I was off to the upstairs to peruse the dresses and clothes. Perhaps it's because this place is in a ritzy suburb and not downtown Boston, but they have a HUGE selection of semi-formal dresses of the kind that Mitzy and her friends would wear to Sunday dinners at the Club. Highly recommend coming here if you're looking for that sort of dress, or  a semi-formal dress for a wedding. Their clothing selection was nicely arranged with many of the designers occupying their own little niches, set back from the aisles. The clothing was well ordered and was not very picked over, excluding the 70% off racks. I tried on a lot of stuff but helas, didn't find anything I liked. I was never approached by a sales associate but didn't go out of my way to seek one out, so that was fine. I'd definitely return here if I am in the area and especially if I needed a dress. Also, the neater arrangement of the clothing and lack of crowds make this location somewhat more appealing than the downtown Boston one. However, the selection is much more limited. As others have noted, there is no home goods section and there are fewer designers represented here. For example, while this location had some of my favorites like Tahari, Ralph Lauren, Inc, and Style & Co., other brands like Free People were no where to be found.", "date": "2010-03-14 19:21:45"}, {"review_id": "95cOByJqt2VettGUi3OyEg", "user_id": "pbi5-1PIC8K-B40LtDoyqw", "business_id": "yIx8OCK_LfqswasRB9YUVg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Macy's Spa  is excellent.

I was told I would be able to just punch in the extension when I called, but that was not true.  What an incredible amount of wasted time.  When I've had fraud issues with my regular AMX card, the fraud people have been excellent and made the process very easy with no paperwork.  This has been a nightmare.

This morning, I logged on to my Macy's account online to order a dress and, unfortunately, discovered that someone else (I didn't know) wanted to use my account, as well. I promptly called Macy's to get things sorted out and they helped fix the fraud, but also had to cancel my Macy's card, which meant that I was unable to place my order online. This left me in an interesting predicament when I HAD to go to the store to purchase my dress. I really do not enjoy \"in person\" shopping. The parking, the browsing, the people, the whole thing is not enjoyable to me. Today, all of those things were not only pleasant, but somewhat enjoyable because of the associates at Macy's. I got a great-ish parking space and was on my way.\nOnce inside, I discovered a HUGE store! Holy moly is it big. Luckily, the associates are great at noticing when someone looks lost and were happy to come ask if I needed help finding something. I made my way to the dress section (with the help of three different associates) and then was assisted by an associate in that section who was great. She found me wandering in the petites section (I'm 5'10\"......) and got me back on track in the right area. I was able to find the exact dress I wanted to buy online, which was awesome. Once in line, and associate rang up my purchase IN LINE with an iphone! How great! I was even able to use my Macy's account with my driver's license, which was my big concern after my card was cancelled. She also apologized that I had that happen, and was quite sincere with the apology. She helped me figure out which coupon would be most beneficial to me, whcih I always appreciate, too. There was a great sale in the shoe department, so I checked that out, as well. I had a similarly great experience in the shoe department with a super efficient \"ordering\" system for the shoe I wanted to try on. Despite the department being extremely busy, my shoes came out quickly, and I was able to purchase in line again. And, again, a very genuine apology about my Macy's account being hacked (I purchased someone in Oregon quite a nice blender).\nOn my way out of the store, I had several people help get me in the right direction without feeling like they thought I was an idiot for getting lost in Macy's (but really, it is huge and easy to get lost).\nThis is a great store and I hope leadership for this location sees this review.

The beginning was fine. Our salesman, Mel, was friendly and helpful. Told us the special order couch and love seat we wanted would be available in 8-10 weeks, I think? But then amended that to 10-12. Then told us later that it would be arriving around the 9 week mark. Which brings me to the one star part.\n\nTwo weeks ago tomorrow (Tuesday) was our first confirmed delivery date. We got a random voicemail with no callback number in the middle of the day (after we had set up the living room for delivery that morning and planned to be home for the 2 hour delivery window) saying that they had the couch but not the love seat, so they couldn't deliver. No question on whether we might just want the couch. They would reschedule the delivery for later in the week when the love seat had been found. \n\nOn Thursday of that week, I called the Macy's showroom and talked to another very friendly salesman, Andre, and he researched the couch and the love seat to 'make sure' they would be delivered on Saturday morning. Apparently the couch was missing now, but he knew they could find it, and all would be delivered on Saturday morning between 8:30 and 10:30. He even called me personally on Friday to confirm that everything was coming on the truck the next day.\n\nSo the truck arrives on Saturday, and the delivery guy comes up and says they only have the love seat. He calls the warehouse in Miami and I talk to someone who says they can't locate the couch now. She will work on it and have some more information to me by Tuesday. Meanwhile we refuse delivery of the love seat because we only want it if we know we will be getting the couch.\n\nOn Tuesday we get a phone call saying they can deliver the couch and love seat on Friday or the following Monday. We set it up for Monday since we can't be there for the delivery window on Friday, and cross our fingers that it is for real this time! \n\nSo today is Monday, and guess what? Macy's just called and said they don't know where the couch is so they can't deliver it today.\n\nI can't even...what? They are going to 'find the couch' and 'deliver it tomorrow', they say. I am not holding my breath. We have now had three delivery windows where we worked to schedule around having someone at the house for those two hours, multiple phone calls with the Macy's warehouse, Macy's customer 'service' and the salesmen at the Macy's furniture gallery and way too much time wasted overall on a couch that as far as we know doesn't actually exist.\n\nDon't buy special order furniture from Macy's if you actually hope to use it within a year of purchasing it.

I could see the sweat stains underneath the armpits from where I was standing, and the suit looked like it had been through much more than being crumpled up in a Target plastic bag. \n\nJust as my cashier were finishing up with me and mom, the other cashier finished up with the lady making the returns, both cashiers looked at each other and the condition of the clothing returned, and the one waiting on me, commented that she wouldn't have taken any of it back and when she finished with us, she would have called a manager over, because there was no way that lady should have been able to returned soiled clothing. \n\nThis Macy's will probably be one of the last possible Macy's in Atlanta to be on a closing list, just because of the popularity of Lenox Square, but overall, it has gone down over the years.", "date": "2017-04-03 02:03:00"}, {"review_id": "FwE2J_8Qiuqb4T-BeQaFCA", "user_id": "0c39BE56OcUUaCf7dB_xSg", "business_id": "yIx8OCK_LfqswasRB9YUVg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "I was so excited when I found out that the Lenox Mall Macy's had a spa and salon.

The lady at the counter said she had appointments from 2pm on. I made my appointment for 3:45pm and even confirmed as I put it in my phone calendar.\n\nI arrived at 3:30 and was told \"Oh we just called you and marked you as a no show\". Confusedly I responded my appointment is at 3:45. The lady had put it in for 2:30. I was all set to leave but they said they would fit me in if I did the express mani/pedi. I said okay. I should have left. \n\nFirst I were gel on my hands which I'm assuming they don't deal with on a regular basis because when I asked the lady to soak my hands as she did my pedicure she looked confused. She then left for 10 minutes and came back with a bowl of acetone. My pedicure went on without a hitch but as she checked on my hand she would use her nails to remove the gel, literally scratching the polish off. That should have been my 2nd clue.\n\nOnce she got done clawing my polish off she quickly \"filed\" my nails. She didn't cut my cuticles or ask if I wanted my nails cut down. She just started painting. Now remember when I said she \"filed\" my nails well, as my paint began to dry I could she ridges all through it. My nail beds had not been filed pretty much at all and you could see all her scratch marks on my nails. When I said something about it she said well your nails are thin and I don't want to hurt you. Ummm WTF?\n\nI've been getting my nails done for almost 15 years and had never had anyone not smooth out my nail beds. Mind you my nail have been thin my entire life. I told her I apreciated her concern but the polish does not look right and she needed to do something else. She told me to wait for the 2nd coat and it would look better. I agreed but even after the 2nd coat it was clearly not right. She did offer to remove it all and do it again but I had a plane to catch and frankly was over it by that point.\n\nThis was done on 10/16 and I got the Vinyl which is supposed to last at least a week.

I generally don't mind clothes shopping at Macy's, but I don't think I'll ever be back to this location. First gripe, the menswear section was totally lame. I've honestly never had such a hard time finding decent clothes at Macy's before. I was looking for some nice, basic items to wear to job interviews, i.e., black slacks, button up shirts, nothing unusual. The men's department here had very little in those types of items, and instead seemed to be full of dorky striped polos, pleated khakis, and dumpy button up shirts with tacky patterns. It's like stuff your lame dad would have worn ten years ago maybe. Even the Ralph Lauren section seemed to be off the mark here, with the majority of items having those stupid oversized logos that seem to exist purely for uglying up otherwise nice clothes.\n\nSecondly, the customer service was downright terrible. I did finally find a couple things worth buying, and when I approached the register I noticed a Macy's employee in front of me in line purchasing items for herself. Not something that would bother me in itself, but she and the girl ringing her up seemed to be taking their sweet time, making small talk, etc, and at one point I noticed the cashier scan a wowpass so this other employee could get an additional discount. When it was finally my turn, the pants I had found rang up for full price, though I had got them off a sale rack. The cashier tried to argue that they were probably put there by a customer and therefore she couldn't do a price adjustment. Then she refused to scan their wowpass for my transaction. She claimed that she wasn't allowed to and that I would have had to bring in my own copy, though every other Macy's I've been to was happy to scan their store copy for me, plus, she had just done exactly that for another employee!\n\nNow, I hate being the asshole who makes some poor cashier call a manager over, but I had wasted too much time already to leave empty handed and at the same time wasn't about to be tricked into paying full price for things that were supposed to be on sale. So, she called the manager over (who turned out  to be the same girl who was buying things on the clock a few minutes earlier), and she reluctantly applied the discounts, but made it very clear she wasn't happy about it. \n\nSo despite getting a good price on an item I liked, it was such an ordeal that it hardly felt worth it.

The manager, who was called to assist, was especially snooty. When asked why we were returning it, my boyfriend answered he wasn't happy with it. The manager, in turn, repeated what he said in a slow, condescending manner after a long pause (\"So....... you weren't.... happy.... with.... it\").

I've always been a fan of Macy's even when the stores used to be Lazarus back in the day. Whenever I need something in particular for an interview, party or just something new, I always go to Macy's. They always have a huge selection and friendly folks that help you.  I stopped in here to cure some 'retail therapy' on a Friday afternoon. This store has a great selection too.  When I stopped in here last fall, one of the ladies working in the womens area was quick to help me find a suit that I needed for an interview. She didnt sell me no $200 suit, but we quickly went over to the clearance section and found a 2-piece suit for $100. Pretty reasonable -- I can wear the jacket with black dress pants or wear it with the skirt it came with.  Plus the lady made sure I had at least three suits to choose from. She waited until I came out of the fitting room to make sure I found what I was looking for. Very nice. It was almost like my Mom was there with me (in a way).

Three different representatives said that it was our fault.\n\nMy girlfriend got abused and got very bad comments from Macy's.com three time from yesterday to today and said that it was her fault when purchasing an item from their website and they also give me false information about the purchase she made. Also, they raised question about the financial status saying that I had insufficient balance but that wasn't true at all. I really want to know that what kind of charge should be applied here ?\n\nThe reason I am posting this article here is because I don't know where else to share this information and this is not a false information, if there's proof required, Macy's.com records every phone call session and everybody can hear the conversation between a customer and the Macy's represetative based on the phone number.\n\nSo we weren't happy with our purchase.So we take all our items to Natick Macys to return it. Our return was mostly perfumes, and when we were entering the store and heading to the perfumes counter  eyebrows were being raised by the associates standing near the counter. Why ? Is it because we have more that five expensive perfumes in our hands. Just to add a key note me and my girlfriend are both Indian. So we went up and we say we want to return these perfumes. And the associate at the counter looks aghast and sort of shakes her head no and tells us shes going to call the manager. So a manager called Nancy shows up and looks at my girlfriend and says \n'you look very familiar do i know you\" and my girlfriend says \"yup you do, i work here\". My girlfriend is a Macy's associate who says hello to this particular manager everytime she sees her. I don't understand why Nancy would say \"Do I know you?\" to someone that works for her. So the manager asks us why we are returning the perfumes and we say we were not happy with the service Macys.com provided us. Since my girlfriend is an associate the manager starts bringing up the stores daily sales and abruptly mentions that the daily earnings of macys sales are going to plunge if we return the items, When I am the one who purchased the perfumes on my credit card. So basically I am the customer here not my girlfriend who works here. And the manager keeps targeting my poor girlfriend just because she works under her and shows her attitude saying that they will loses sales. And then she asks \"why did you buy so many perfumes?\" Why would any associate ask a customer why they are buying lots of things? So as you can see here they were suspecting us who are new to the country from India for buying alot of perfumes. So my girlfriend says that its for her clients and she needs to send them. (my girlfriend helps the handicapped and hospital patients who cant get out of bed, by shopping for them and returning things they don't want. So one of her clients wanted a lot of perfumes and only decided to keep a few, so there for the reason of return). The Manager starts bring up that we are doing something illegal just because we used the word client. What? Who says that especially a Manager. After she accuses my girlfriend of doing illegal activity she takes down her full name. And without hesitation my girlfriend gave her name. And i got furious and ask her why is she taking down her name? What wrong did she do ? All we wanted to do was to return the items. And the Manager Nancy keeps ranting on and on and would never let the customer which is me complete my sentence. We really felt like That manager and the associates at the perfume counter were treating us differently than any other customer and i believe it is because of our skin tone and because my girlfriend works under her.The manager took advantage of that fact and basically disrespected her by saying shes doing something illegal. Why does Macys have egoistic, unapproachable managers who have a bad attitude towards their employees and most importantly a customer like me? Why was Nancy treating me like i worked under her as well? Why would anyone ask personal questions like what we do with the products? Doesn't matter if i throw out the products or actually use them no one should question me.\n\nWe were abused at Macys.com and at Macys Natick! We never expected this and we always tell our family back home in India how much my girlfriend enjoys her job at Macy's and what a great place it is. Now we both are speechless and shocked.\n\n Why are normal customer like us get targeted? Is Macy's still continuing racial discrimination as they did before so many times with other people? Just because Macy's is a big company, do they have the right to say or abuse like that ?", "date": "2014-03-24 13:12:19"}, {"review_id": "YmhSD0O53WjAwNAowPgyug", "user_id": "NUiYBlFVdiPPzWGkHaZTrg", "business_id": "p05BaSFza5U8MRUXAciB2Q", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Horrible service.

A few minutes later a Black woman named Barbara showed up and started helping an old women, we didn't mind even though we were first, shes an old women help her no issues.  It did take quite awhile to wait for that transaction though.  She then started helping another woman and skipped over us again.  She told us that we would be next and sorry for the wait.  So we waited again.  Finally when she was through she told us that she was going to take yet Another customer and we'd be next????? Are you kidding?   A person that Just showed up!  We starting thinking this was some kind of Racist BS as we are an interracial couple. Perhaps not perhaps shes just inherently rude all the time. It had been around 40 minutes now. The jewelry clerk told us that a manager would get us started to help us.  She told him (Black male manager -forgot what his name was-) and then he just stood there for a few minutes even after acknowledging her, finally came over and I just said, \"No, thank you we are good, we might be back we might not\",  Clerk: Are you sure, hes right here?  I replied with: I waited over 20 then 30 to 40 minutes for your help and nothing\"  We walked off.\n\nMy Girlfriend made a complaint to the macys website and days later got a call she missed but got the voicemail telling her that it was the manager from Jewelry \"A different woman\"  and to please call her back.\n\nSo my Girlfriend called back to the Jewelry department thinking it would just be an apology.  The Clerk we had trouble with before picked up the phone and said the manager was not their, My girlfriend left her name to tell her that she just called.   Heres where it gets messed up.  The woman on the phone starts arguing with my girlfriend that she wasn't rude when we were their the other day and that she thinks she was wrong.

The only way she would know that is if her boss that had to talk to her about her behavior told her about personal information about the person that sent the complaint.  Which I know is against policy.\n\nMy girlfriend did get ahold of the Jewelry Manager, but they didnt care in the least. they made up excuses for the clerk and didn't care one bit about them arguing over the phone to a customer.

I noticed that the older lady quickly went over to another White lady and asked if she needed help...\n\n2) We went over to the shoe department to try to ask for the manager and the girl there rolled her eyes, and took a long breath as if we were taking up her time and asked \"What's the point of coming here to ask for a manager...We can't help you.\" I was soooo infuriated at that point and told her \"YOU HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO HELP JUST SAY SO\"....We immediately left that area and guess what???That same shoe associate ran after us.......YES....RAN  after us and tried to fakely apologize for how she acted, but the damaged was already done! (But, that's not the worst!)\n\n3) Immediately, we went to the First and ONLY associate around (The same old lady that was pretty unfriendly to me, but nice to my White Fiance) and asked her to contact a manager. She had witnessed the girl from the shoe department RUNNING after us to apologize and ignored my request and stated  \"You guys need to calm down and let it go..there is no need to get mad.\"  At this point my fiance and I looked everywhere, aside from all the shocked looks from other customers, NO ONE  (especially a manger) sufficed.  We went over to the make up counter and inquired also, but only got another snotty girl stating that she does not know where the manager is.\n\n4) I went home and wrote Macy's an email in regards to what happened and got a pretty generic email apologize for what happened two weeks later.\n\nI just wanted to say respect and kindness goes a long way, especially if you are in sales.

Nobody wants to do that if they don't have to.\n\nI got to Macy's and went to the counter that the employee had told me to go to. They did not have my item on hold there. Multiple employees looked around at all the various desks and storage areas, and could not find it. There was a display model on the floor, but it was dirty and there was no box. Eventually the manager found another display model of the stand in the stock room. Turns out that the employee on the phone never even found the boxed stand, but lied about it and took my name and phone number for no reason. Apparently the two display models were the \"two\" they had in stock, so they never had boxed ones to begin with.\n\nThankfully, the manager on duty was able to order me a new stand for delivery. However, it was a colossal waste of time considering if I was going to order it, I would have done that in the first place instead of driving all the way out to Tanasbourne in weeknight traffic.\n\nDuring this whole ordeal, there was another employee at the main Home Goods desk that basically stood and watched everything happen. When other customers would come up, she would look around idly, and if the customers didn't go away, after a minute or two she would say \"I can help you over here\".

I also realized how challenging it can be to find good skinny ties, which leads me to believe that online may be the best way to go.  In-person, Macy's seemed to have the best selection and, coincidentally, was running a one-day sale on men's neckwear.\n\nI found a Georgia Tech gold-colored tie for $65.  The one-day sale discounted the tie 40%, so I was able to get it for $39 (+8% sales tax).  I thought this was reasonable after trying the tie on and given the tie's quality and the time constraints I was facing.  A fellow with an Eastern European accent checked me out.  He persistently tried to get me to sign up for a Macy's card.  I declined.\n\nThe men's neckwear section was organized for the most part.  However, some of the display furniture and stands were in poor condition.  A couple examples include: (1) one of the wooden display table's legs was kicked in, about to give way -- it did not look safe, (2) a couple of the metal rotating necktie stands were broken -- they were lopsided and didn't even turn.", "date": "2014-10-26 13:46:47"}, {"review_id": "7zqTO2ru2Yw1nEtmsuZ-cA", "user_id": "_p4JZKcJcbMUC6Wp61lNBw", "business_id": "C4d3mgHdmhCrHtnVJHE9Tg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "This isn't your average Macy's...This whole department store caters to the \"Chestnut Hill\" girl...They have accessories and cosmetics downstairs and then the second floor is dedicated to cute clothes!

I do not have a huge problem with Macy's though, they seem to be about the same as every other department store. I go in one maybe once a year because I need something or because there is a ridiculous sale. This time it was the latter.\n\nMacy's was selling the Dyson DC18 for $149 closeout. The normal retail price on this was around $500. I had been looking for a good vacuum and this seemed to be an incredible deal. Normally I would order it on their website, but the website closeout price was $300 so I had to venture into the store.\n\nSurprisingly the store was not that busy, though I did go the week before Christmas during the afternoon, not after 9-5 hours were over. I had all my paper work and part numbers prepared. I am glad I did too, because Macy's computer system cannot look up an item if you do not have the UPC. The lady in housewares said they did not have it in stock (I already knew that). I asked her if she could help me in ordering it from the warehouse. She said they could not do that (I knew they could). I said okay and went directly to customer service.\n\nThe guy there looked very much like David K. It threw me off at first. He was very glad to help me order the item. He remarked at how awesome a deal it was. I suggested he place an order for himself right after I leave. I tired to use the 20% off coupon, which he was willing to use, but the computer did not let him because it was an excluded item. Oh well, I was pretty sure it would not work anyway. I did get them to give me free shipping as I told them their website was offering free shipping on orders over $100 and I had a copy of a receipt from someone online who had gotten them to take off shipping as well. The manager was nice and took it off.\n\nIt said it would ship within six days and it shipped the next day on UPS ground from Phoenix. My delivery date is the 24th and I will definitely be vacuuming on Christmas haha. Very nice people work here, but some of them are pretty incompetent, but I was guessing they were only working there for a few weeks for the holidays and did not know the computer system that well.

This product was available for a fantastic price, so I was genuinely excited to get it.  I received a confirmation email and notification that it had shipped, and would be arriving on Saturday.  I checked on Wednesday and Thursday of that week to see if the price went any lower, but it hadn't.  In the meantime, nothing had changed on my delivery date, it was still due on the Saturday.  On Friday, I checked again, and the product was no longer available, but my tracking number said it would still be here Saturday (tomorrow).  I called Macy's, and the girl confirmed that Yes, it was still coming tomorrow.\n\nStarting to get a bit nervous, I went to the UPS website and put in the tracking number, and they said it hadn't even been delivered to their site yet.  So, I called Macy's again, only to find out that my order, to which Macy's had taken my money and given my a tracking number and date of arrival, said that apparently my package got lost in the warehouse and, because there were no more of my product in stock, then I was out of luck and could only be offered a refund.  I told them I didn't want a refund, I wanted the product at the great price it was offered.  They however refused to reorder the product and honor the price they offered.  Instead, all I got was some fake and insincere, \"We're sorries\" from the supervisor and a promise to refund my money.\n\nIt is disgusting that a corporation like Macy's refuses to take care of their customers and put them first.  Instead, they would rather sit idly by and watch their loyal customers like myself become disgruntled and never go back there (which I won't).  It's also appalling at the lack of training that Macy's employees get.  It seems that not one person knows what's going on, and that you never get the same response twice.  \n\nBottom line, I will never be going back because of this experience.  As it was, I wasn't going much because of the ridiculous way they offer coupons, where literally 90% of the items are excluded.  Basically, you can buy Jelly Belly jelly beans with the coupon, as that's the only product not excluded.\n\nWhat an absolutely disgusting and frustrating experience!!!

Before Christmas, he ordered a lot of clothing.... shirts, pants, blazer, suit.... at Macy's online.  Because it had been ages since he purchased any work clothing, neither of us knew what size he wore.  None of the new clothes fit even though we had followed measuring guidelines.  It was obvious to us that we needed to go to Macy's for a professional fitting and to return or alter all the purchases.  This was a pretty daunting and time-consuming task and we did not look forward to it.  First, I want to say that I have not been in a shopping mall for years and order everything online.  I had pictured kind of a gloomy environment full of overworked and perhaps underpaid grumpy employees.  Boy, was I wrong!  First, I am 73 and the nostalgia hit me, remembering years excited to be combing through the racks of clothes in Cincinnati at Shillito's, then Federated, then Macy's with the meager check a young secretary made back in the 60s held tight in my hands, willing to spend.  But first, we had to exchange these clothes.  Christy in returns was great.  She really was so friendly and accommodating.  No adversarial customer relationship which I kind of expected since we were returning so much and creating so much work for her at the end of the day.  She was sweet, charming, and told us we might be able to get the same price on the correct size when we spoke with the salesperson in Men's Clothing.  We went there and met with Mohammed which made it our lucky day.  This poor guy was apparently covering half of the floor!  People kept interrupting us, trying to get him to show them shoes, find their size in a dress shirt, etc.  We were very patient since we knew we were throwing a glitch into everything and we were fine with waiting.  He never got flustered and was always kind and willing to help.  He fit my husband, offering alterations and everything he advised ended up looking so good on him.  And he honored the prices of the original order!  We were probably there a couple hours but it was worth it.  Mohammed just took care of us between customers so well, amid myriad interruptions for which he apologized.  It couldn't have been helped and he had a lot on his plate being the only salesperson I could see anywhere around.  In the end, we were very happy.  He is a gem, and I hope Macy's appreciates him.  Even Susan, a woman who was going counter to counter to refill brochures, was a chirpy, happy person to encounter.  I was so pleased with our whole experience that now I plan to return to the store mostly based on these wonderful people.  Online ordering is so convenient, yet there is nothing like the human interactions we had as well as actually feeling the cloth clothes are made of and the weight of the fabric and seeing the true colors not distorted on a computer screen.

This is the absolute worst place to purchase your furniture. Do NOT come here. I repeat. Do NOT come here. (I feel the need to repeat again that's how strongly I feel, but I will continue....) My husband and I moved into our new home in February 2016. We've slowly been taking our time furnishing the place. We are so excited since this is our first home and we want to get the right stuff. We finally decided to purchase a couch and arm chair for our formal living room and decided to go to Macy's as they were having a sale. The sales lady - COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT - took hours to ring us up. We had a gift card and asked for a different color than what was on display (but was still a color that was available for immediate delivery). That's it. Nothing too complicated. Yet it took forever as she had to speak with other salespeople and upper management to figure out what to do with the gift card. When she finally figured out the gift card (took her several tries), she was ready to complete the purchase until my husband noticed her computer screen listed the wrong color after we repeatedly told her we wanted the smoke gray instead of the blue. (Also, they have to switch from their ipads to a computer which seems like a total waste of time to me). Saleslady, please remove \"great attention to detail\" from your resume. FINALLY, she completed checking us out. We were scheduled for the following week delivery (July 27). We were told we would get a call at least a day before to confirm the delivery time. This sounded perfect to us because we were having guests over that weekend for the first time since we bought our home and now people would have a place to sit. Yesterday (July 26) we received no call from Macy's about our upcoming delivery. We figured no big deal, they will give us a call tomorrow several hours before the delivery. July 27 has arrived and NOTHING, so WE had to call THEM. Aaaand, it turns out the furniture we purchased which they previously informed us was available and ready to deliver on July 27 was not ready to be delivered because the sofa is apparently not available until early August and the arm chair is not ready until October. We try to speak with a supervisor to figure out what is going on. The supervisor tells us, nevermind, the furniture IS available and they will just have to delivery a day or two late. I'm thinking...Okay fine, that's better. At least we'll still get it before our party this weekend. But NOOOOOO, we get a call back and we get the run around yet again. Indeed, the sofa is on back order until August and the chair until October. Apparently they talked to \"the warehouse\" and the lady with whom we previously spoke was wrong. IDIOTS!

You can get some ridiculous deals going if you know what you're doing and ride the gift with purchase train. I look online to see and boom! Not only does Clinique have a gift with purchase going right now but it's an incredible one where you get to choose some options. With buying the large size bottle of my cleanser I got a full tub of amazing moisturizer (have and I am not talking about that crappy yellow one that they try giving away all the time everyone hates), three other amazing and decent-sized cleansers, a gorgeous lipstick, a beautiful lip liner and a very ugly bag. I will say though, Clinique always has really ugly bags... I cannot remember actually ever receiving a good-looking bag from Clinique. To heck with the bag though, I was happy enough getting almost $70 in free product. I wanted to try the fancy I store them that they had which one of the other sample packs did have but I really wanted the lip one because I love the lipstick and lip liner that came with it. The really nice lady that was helping me tried to give me a sample but she couldn't find the sample container of the serum. She was telling me that the serum sample would be about the same size as what she was going to give me but when she wasn't able to give me the sample manually she just threw in one of the extras from the gift with purchase which was so sweet of her.\n\nThere are few sections at Macy's, of the store, that I always glance at because when they have a sale they have an incredible one.

I wear a DDD ladies and those of you in this sizing and up know that challenge of getting a bra in your size first off. Next, finding something actually attractive and not paying out of the ass for it. This bra even had sizes G etc and was cute as hell in multiple colors.

These restrooms are worse than a old gas station in some random town. I opened all the stalls except for one because it was occupied and every stall had feces and old yellow urine in it. There was toliet paper on the floors and I almost got sick looking at these restroom stalls. No excuse for that. The lady who came out of the occupied stall said her toliet was dirty too but she just cleaned it and used it because she really could not wait. So for those you ladies reading this post, flush after you use it. We are adults so please act like it. If you don't like touching the handle with your hand like I don't then just use your foot with your shoe to flush.\n It is basic manners people. The store employees and other customers shouldn't be flushing after you. I left without using the toliet and I could have spent more money there because I wanted to buy some more outfits but I needed to leave this Macy's to use the restroom elsewhere.\n\n\nSo on my most recent trip yesterday a little update on the restrooms situation: yes, amen!

It's clean, bright, spacious, neat and well organized. It's hard to differentiate this area from the main floor as it seamlessly blends aesthetically and is so well maintained. Definitely the best I've seen and it's a pleasure to shop here. \n\nBackstage is Macy's version of a discount store similar to Marshall's but at a much, much smaller scale. They have a little of everything - clothing, bedding, housewares, kitchen gadgets, home decor, shoes, seasonal, handbags, accessories, luggage, pet items, lamps, art, and holiday items. \n\nMen's, women's and children's clothing are at lower prices but are also of lower quality than the main store. These are not items that were in Macy's and moved to Backstage; those items go to Last Act on the main floor. The items in Backstage seem to have been made for this purpose similar to how Nordstrom Rack carries a different and lower quality item.\n\nThe Tory Burch tote is what caught my eye and when I saw the price, I was confused. Just $199 and originally $298, it was a bargain. That's when I looked up and realized I was in the Backstage area. The canvas tote with signature logo in camel leather and matching straps was classic and simple elegance. Timeless and for every season. I had to resist buying it as handbags are a known weakness! But since the pandemic started, I've gotten dressed up 3-4 times, and that includes Christmas, Eve, Christmas Day and New Year's! So I swung it on my shoulder, looked in the mirror and smiled, then did a catch and release. \n\nThe day I was there they had lots of other purses; tons of sweaters in neutrals as well as colors; loungewear, the new pandemic clothing attire; pants, jeans, coats, pajamas. Basically everything!\n\nSince Macy's has a sale practically everyday and sales often apply to items that are marked down, I rarely shop in Backstage because I can get higher quality items at phenomenal prices. The Tannesbourne location is now the exception! With beautiful clothes neatly arranged on racks with plenty of space in between the clothing and between the racks so that you can browse the selection without frustration, I make a bee line to this department!\n\nWhile at Backstage, do check out the kitchen area. It is small, but I always find a gadget I need or to replace one that is old. Bakeware , small white dishes and bowls and serving pieces are also great finds for under $10.00.  The home decor area has textured pillows, throws, candles, frames and seasonal items. Easy to find a gift or a small item to give your room a perk-me-up.  \n\nThis Macy's is not anywhere close to my home! But now that Lloyd Center Macy's is closed, I come here even though it's further than Clackamas or Washington Square because I like that it's small.

There were some issues with using a gift card in conjunction with a Macy's credit card, but the sales associate figured that part out after some time, no problem. At the end of the transaction, the computer froze & my receipt could not print. The sales associate asked another associate on the floor for help but they couldn't figure it out & called for a manager to assist. We waited a little over 10 minutes until another sales associate walked by & asked my sales associate if she was okay (The manager never came by the way) My sales associate told the other associate that she was not okay because the computer froze & she couldn't get it to work & had been waiting on a manager to assist. So the other sales associate comes over & asks me how I normally get my receipt. I told her I wanted a printed receipt. She repeated her question & I repeated my answer. She then says \"that's not the question I asked you but okay.\" Hm  That caught me off guard. Her voice was \"nice\" but her disposition was very off putting & negative. Prior to her coming over, I & my sales associate were patiently waiting for a manager without issue. Perhaps this other sales associate assumed that I was giving my sales associate a hard time about the computer being frozen so she came over with whatever complex she had & decided to be the big bad wolf, idk. So after the other sales associate rudely says \"that's not the question I asked you but okay,\" I told her that I don't shop at Macy's so I don't normally get my receipt in any form. (I was shopping for a relative who could not risk being in the mall during COVID because she's a senior citizen). Her original question was irrelevant & her repeating her irrelevant question was unnecessary. At that point it didn't matter what type of receipt I normally got, because I told her that I wanted a paper receipt that day (mainly because there were issues with the gift card processing earlier & I wanted to make sure everything went through). The other sales associate begins rebooting the system & moves to another computer to help other customers. My sales associate and I wait another 10 minutes for the system to reboot. While I continue to patiently wait... the other sales associate for one reason or another decides to force dialogue on me (after being unnecessarily combative moments before) She asks me (another irrelevant question) \"what form of payment did you use?\" I almost didn't answer her because I could tell she doesn't get much attention & was needing some that day & obviously likes to antagonize people, but I answered her & said \"a Macy's card\" she then said \"thank you\" in a very condescending sort of tone. It was all very weird & left me feeling very unsettled, so much so that I'm writing this review. I'm a fairly laid back individual & don't expect a whole lot as a customer. I just like to grab my items & go but this lady gave BAD vibes. The sales associate with the nasty disposition was named GiGi. My sales associate was gracious & kind... her name is LaKendra. To management: have GiGi check her complex at the door & leave the combative energy at home.", "date": "2020-12-13 03:35:45"}, {"review_id": "AkPUxNzWaetv03bK-0-01g", "user_id": "r1hiUtN_rJfELVNqEF8ipw", "business_id": "KFS2fEwq5nnsaFJkNtCNiw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "The staff here are always so nice.

I love the way she styles brows.  I always feel a million dollars better, after she tightens me up.  I get so many compliments on my brows when she HELPS me!!! She is a brow genius, no lie.  There is technique and artist skill when it comes to the perfect brow. \nEasily my favorite reason to visit her is for lashes.  I feel confident applying strip lashes, and most of the time they are great.  For special occasions or hectic work schedules I HIGHLY recommend the semi-permanent lashes.  Why? It saves you time and makes you look younger.\n1. Lucious lashes make you appear younger and healthy-associated with youth and quality lifestyle. Aka men like lashes!!!\n2. Saves you time in the morning. Your eyes will look almost done when you wake up.  I will skip eye makeup all together except concealer.  Makes me look awake and polished.\n3. It's so much easier having her apply them and have them last for the 1-1.5 weeks vs. me spending time making the strip lash look like it \"belongs\". Full face makeup vs. barely there. Aka you look younger\n\nLarissa is also super funny.  It is always great experience chatting with her.  She laughs at herself all the time but she is obviously talented.  \n\nIf you are looking for a new brow artist, she is the one. If you have a special occasion, I recommend visiting her for lashes ASAP!!! \n\nTime to get beautiful!!!!\n\n\nThings I have learned, to help you have the best experience:\n\nIf you would like some makeup done for a special occasion, typically accommodations can be pre-arranged with your service.  They are not going to make you buy anything, just remember time is money.  You want full glam transformation? It's standard etiquette to buy at least two products.  Why? The makeup artists typically are not allowed to receive tips, it's considered taboo.  It's preferred you show your appreciation for the new look by adding to your personal repertoire of makeup.\n***Larissa is an esthetician though, separate from the behind the counter help.  As a service provider, Larissa does accept tips.  NOTE: if it is important to you, to show your gratitude through tipping, bring cash. No atms in the store and no tips via card.

I said that I had looked up hours, but she told me that the website was wrong because it lists the store's hours, not the brow bar hours.  I was befuddled and ticked off because it was the Friday night before my company holiday party and my regular eyebrow lady was out of town.  Plus I had done my job and looked up the hours.  I could have gotten to the store earlier if I had know the hours listed were inaccurate.  I will point out that at this point, the lady (Larissa?) did not ask me what services I needed or offer to make an exception given the misinformation. \n\nI walked away.  But I was mad. I thought perhaps I had messed up and looked at the Macy's site instead, so then I looked up the website again on my phone.  Upon confirming that I had actually gotten the information from Benefit's website, I marched myself right back to the brow bar and challenged the closing time, pointing out that it wasn't my fault that Benefit listed the wrong hours and I had planned my schedule accordingly.  This time, the lady was more accommodating and said she'd make an exception.  I only wanted a tweezing job to clean up my brows (don't like wax as I usually thread and certainly am not taking a risk with a person whose skills are unknown to me). I really wish she had volunteered this the first go-round and saved me some emotional turmoil.\n\nOnce we got past all that, the rest of the experience was fine.  Larissa is a pleasant woman. My eyebrows were done well enough, but not as good results as I get from my threading lady.  I didn't like the fact that she put makeup on my brows without asking me first, so I couldn't really assess how well she had tweezed until I got home and washed that stuff off (plus I have thick eyebrows on my own, so the \"brow stuff\" was unnecessary.)  Then of course, I felt the need to tip because I had made her stay late, but honestly I don't think the brow tweezing itself was all that special.  Hence, an average tweezing job cost me $25, which is highway robbery.  At least I felt ready for the party, though, so I'm grateful for that.\n\nIf you don't have a go-to person for brows, or you prefer waxing and don't mind the high price tag, I think Larissa does a fine job and is probably better with the wax than tweezing (just my suspicion based on reviews).  As long as you don't encounter the same closing time issue I had, the service experience should be fine.

The salesperson was very helpful and bent over backwards to help us. She even gave us a special 5% discount because we were buying a few weeks before the scheduled tax holiday. That's why this review has any stars at all.\n\nWe ordered a bed, two nightstands, and two chests of drawers, being told it would be delivered in about two weeks.  The day arrived and the truck pulled up, and they started unwrapping the furniture from their cardboard boxes. Woops! The bed and one of the chests were badly damaged. You see, they get the stuff wrapped in cardboard boxes directly from the warehouse so they have no idea of the condition until they get it to your house. In their defense, the workers were the ones who noticed the damage and told us they didn't feel right about leaving it with us. They'd process the replacement request, etc.  \n\nI followed up with my sales rep who apologized and said she could deliver the bed, but the chest would be on backorder.  A couple weeks later the bed arrived... 3 hours late. The workers brought it in and started to assemble it. They asked me to borrow a few allen wrenches, so I lent them what I had. They asked if I had a power screwdriver. I lent it to them as well. Then I hear one of them talking about \"cutting it somehow so it will be easier.\" One of the guys goes out to the van, we hear some loud banging, and he comes back in and goes back to work. \n\nAfter an hour, they emerg from the room and ask if my wife and I planned to use the bed tonight, or if it could wait. I tell them we planned to use it, of course. They tell me the hardware that came with the bed is bad. I'll have to place a request for a \"service call\" and get new hardware. They left.\n\nI looked at the mess they had left, and examined the hardware. I couldn't believe it.  They had attempted to drive the allen bolts into the bed frame by using the power screwdriver. They had stripped them in the process. Then I found the one bolt that was bent. In an effort to make it easier, the had tried to snap the bolt in half to make it easier. I managed to get the allen wrench to fit into all the bolts but one, and after spending over an hour of be able to turn each one only a fraction at a time, I was able to put the bed together and salvage it.\n\nIt has now been over a month since then, a month and a half overall, and we still have no chest.

With the Christmas shopping season starting, however, the parking lots will fill up. Especially on the final days leading up to Christmas Eve. Like as if you don't know that!\nAnyway, I entered the store through the mens department. And fortunately, there was a sales woman working the register. So she was able to ring up my purchase and get me out of the store in just a few minutes.There was also a salesman working the department who was very cordial.\nIn past visits, I have had times were I have had to walk through the store to find a sales associate. And there have been several times I have come into the store, only to find salespeople having a conversation and not stopping to offer assistance. On my last visit to Macy's before this afternoon, I had to buy some socks in the mens department. I waited not even a minute before I had a salesman greeting me and asking if I needed assistance. So I hope that the last two outings are a sign of improvement.\nAs for clothes, I am disappointed since there is not a selection for big or tall men. I will admit, Macy's carries a nice selection of clothes. Providing that you are not a plus size. The housewares and kitchen departments have a nice selection of products for the home. I love to cook! So I can spend hours in the kitchen department, looking at all the neat appliances I wish I had in my kitchen! I also like the cologne department. I think Macy's has one of the better cologne/perfume departments around.\nLike I said, I came in to buy a gift card for a relative who lives out of town. The gift card is good for other locations, which is nice since some Macy's locations have a larger selection of products that the Macy's at Fashion Square may not carry.\nI like this store. And I am happy that it is located at Fashion Square. I had hoped that Macy's would help draw other stores to this location. Unfortunately, I still see empty storefronts throughout the mall.

We went in and noticed that they were running a special on it again but not quite as cheap as I've seen it in the past.  About that time I was approached by a seasoned customer service rep (Tom).  I know that Macy's runs frequent coupons etc. so I explained what my target price point was and inquired about any additional ways to accomplish my goal.  Now keep in mind, Tom was exceedingly helpful, professional and, most importantly, not pushy in any way. He explained that I could save an additional $100 by opening a Macy's card which would accomplish my goal precisely.  So far...so good. \n\nHere's the rub. Tom then mentioned that the sofa would be subject to a delivery fee of $95. I commented that I could easily pick up and transport the sofa so \"that's not a problem.\"  He then explained that this particular store is a \"showroom\" only and that they have the sofa transported from Seattle or LA.  Furthermore, in the unlikely event that I wanted to drive to LA (no doubt out of pure spite for having to pay $95) neither of those locations were set up for local pickup.  \n\nBottom line is that the advertised price for this sofa (and presumably every piece of furniture at that location) is subject to an additional, and unavoidable, delivery fee. That means a posted price of $1,000 is actually $1,095.  Given that this is not posted anywhere on the sofa (I triple checked) it amounts to some sneaky bullshit. \n\nAgain, in the unlikely event that someone at Macy's reads this, or even remotely cares, I am not complaining about Tom who actually impressed me as a great sales rep.

I'm told that since its jewelry I had to go to the jewelry counter which I was escorted over to then I was told to wait as they help phone customers.  It took me over 30 mins to pick up and item I paid for.  The only good costumer service was done by the girl behind the jewelry counter who apologized for the wait.

The only reason it's getting one star, is because the salesman my boyfriend and I spoke to on the first day (Neil) was professional, nice, knowledgable and very helpful in choosing our mattress. \nMy boyfriend and I (both 27 years old) are moving in together. As a gift, my parents wanted to buy us a bed. We shopped around and found an amazing Simmons mattress with the help of an associate (who was amazing), although we were coming back the next day to make a purchase, he informed us he would not be there - I wanted to make sure he got the proper credit for helping us choose. We returned the next day to another associate (seeming professional at the time) set up the order for the other salesman the next day ( because it was the start of the sale where we could get an additional 10% off the sale price). We set a date 4/20 for the delivery between 2:30-4:30 (today). \nAll this week we have been hustling to get the room ready (painting, etc.) so we could stay in the new place tonight. I took today off of work so that I could be there for the bed to arrive. Never came! No calls, or email updates were never received. I called the Macy's hotline and they had no record of our order. I said two Hail Mary's for the manager I would be talking to about the matter because I was livid. However, I don't believe that yelling at someone solves a problem, so I am always courteous no matter the problem at hand - theres always a solution. \nI find out, mattress order was never sent. I know it was probably miscommunication between the sales rep who started the order, who probably never informed the salesman we spoke with. I was there by myself, and the manager informed me that we would obviously still get the sale price, and I said I would have my parents come back because I didn't have their charge card naturally. I expressed that I was really frustrated because I had taken time off work, and was set to stay at the new place tonight. The manager had the balls to say to me \"There's always the couch\". I stared at him for a minute and just walked away even more pissed. Are you KIDDING me!? I should've been sleeping on a mattress I had ordered two weeks ago... They dropped the ball on this, and he had the nerve to talk to me like that! I know I look very young for my age, and I didn't pay for the mattress, I don't care what this guy thought, I can't believe he spoke to a customer like that. We were thinking about purchasing other furnishings from the store, but after that my boyfriend and I are taking our money elsewhere. When my parents went in, the guy who wrote the sale up for us pretended to not remember. Great job, buddy. Way to own up to the fact you played a huge role in this big mistake.\nStill waiting to hear if we are getting an additional discount for the extreme inconvenience it has caused us.

Though I must admit it's a nice looking store (it definitely improved in the last few years--it used to look like a dump), the salespeople are very snotty.  A few years ago, I was looking for a pocketbook and I wanted to see how many pockets and sections they had.  So of course, I had the look inside them.  The saleslady in that section flipped out.  \"You can't look inside them!\"  Why not?  I was planning to drop $300 dollars plus on a pocketbook.  I should be able to see what's inside of it!  I asked her where the Coach bags were and she said, \"You don't look like you can afford one of those.  Here's the Guess bags.  They're all under $100.\"  Come again?  So I ended up buying a Coach bag in Nordstrom, where they treated me like a normal human being and let me look inside all the bags, even the $1000 Kate Spade & Burberry ones.\n\nUnfortunately, I hate going into Sephora and Ulta stocks only about 3 things from Benefit cosmetics so I have to buy them in Macy's.  They're not much better than Sephora in the attitude department.  If they see you looking around in the makeup section, they come RUNNING up to you, like you're about to give yourself a five fingered discount and take off.  This time a Kardasian wannabe said to me \"You're going to buy that, right?\"  Nice customer service, huh?  It would be nice not to be treated like a criminal for once, but I suppose that's not the Macy's way.\n\nThe only plus is they do have very good sales, so if you like designer and name brand clothes cheap, this is the place to go.  I bought my daughter a pair of Levi's jeans and a Polo sweater for under $20.  They used to have beautiful kids clothes, but they've gone WAY downhill.  Unless you're buying Levi's or Polo's, you're better off going to Target.   Their quality is about the same and the prices are cheaper overall.\n\nOh yeah, I agree with the other reviewer about the restrooms.  They are tucked away in a corner on the main floor.

The first floor is all furniture, and pretty nice.  I didn't spend too much time down there, but it's your typical Macy's Home.  \n\nThe Men's department occupies the whole second floor.  It is pretty amazing where each brand/designer is separate.  This makes it easier to shop around.  The new store offers many brands that the old Macy's men's department didn't.  It still has the usual Lacoste, Polo, Nautica, Lucky Brand, Claiborne, Calvin Klein, Buffalo, Kenneth Cole, North Face, Nike, etc., etc.  However, now each department is a lot bigger, kind of like a mini store within the store if you get what I mean.  Additionally, they now have Antik Denim, Ed Hardy, Hugo Boss, and some others.  The shoe department is bigger, but still lacking IMO.  \n\nI've found some good deals there so far, and I like how it's still too new and most people don't know it's open yet, more selection for me, but I guess it's time to share the wealth.  \n\nI didn't give it 5 stars only because Macy's East in general should follow the model of Macy's West, and start offering some more higher end brands.

It was the most absurd shopping experience I've ever endured. On top of that, my whole plan was to purchase the couch on a Macy's card to take advantage of a 12 months, no interest promotion.

I asked if I could return the items because of everything that happened and they said I would be charged a restocking fee. So I urge you. PLEASE DO NOT SHOP HERE. And if you do. Make sure you add up your purchases yourself so you don't get over charged.

I decided I really liked a sofa and love seat set that I saw on Macys.com and we went to Macy's to look at the sofa at the location in Beaverton, Oregon on Hall Blvd. Right next to Target and behind the actual Washington square mall.\nWe walked inside of the Macy's Furniture store and right away we were approached by a tall sales woman. She did the usual \"What can I help you find today?\" Kind of a thing. My husband told her that we were just browsing - because we really wanted to see the sofa before we got a sales person involved. We walked about 15 feet and a second sales person approached us (a male) and asked us the same questions. My husband, again told this man that we were fine, thank you, but we are just looking around right now. We walked another 15 feet and the same tall woman approached us and said \"Hi. I want to give you my card\" and she held out her business card to my husband. This is the 3rd time we were interrupted in a 5 minute period of time. My husband said \"No. We don't want your card, thanks.\" She looked surprised and said \"Oh, are you working with someone else???\" I said \"No, we're not working with anyone. We just want to look around first\". We continued walking and I found the sofa that I'd seen online. It wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but I sat down on it anyway to try it out. A 3rd sales person approached us (another male) and said \"Can I help you with something?\" My husband said \"No, this is the fourth time we've been interrupted and we just want to browse right now.\" He said this in an exasperated manor. The salesman then YELLED \"Well, you don't have to be so rude!!!!!\" Salesman #3 full on lost control over himself and yelled at us. Then he walked away toward the front door. We hadn't even made it through a quarter of the store yet. So I told my husband that I wanted to leave. I was shocked by the salesman's horrible treatment. So we approached the front door and when we were about 10 feet from the door my husband said to the salesman \"You know, we were going to spend about $6000 or more at Macys when we move into our new house but some other company will get our money now\" My husband didnt yell. He just simply stated this fact. The salesman YELLED \"Well, have a GREAT day you two!!!\" very sarcastically as we left and there were 4 new customers coming in.

The morning of what should have been delivery day, I received a phone call at 7am from the delivery man saying he was 5 minutes away from my new house and wanted to deliver it. I told him it would be too early, it was 25 minutes before the scheduled time slot I was told in the email. I also wouldn't be receiving my keys to the place until 7:30am. I asked him to wait until 7:30am and he said he could not do that. I asked if they could deliver the next day instead and he said \"sure, let me have the dispatcher call you to set up a new delivery time.\" The dispatcher called me a few minutes later and I explained the situation. I asked if the couch could be delivered the next day and she said, \"no.\" Not  let me see what else is available, she just said no. When I explained the delivery man told me he could, her response was \"well, he's just a delivery guy he doesn't know\" and when I asked why she couldn't help me her response was \"well I'm just a dispatcher I don't know.\" I ended up hanging up because she was so rude and didn't help me whatsoever.\n\nI ended up calling the delivery customer service line later and spoke to someone else, and she offered me a delivery date of March 27th, which was 8 days away. I asked if the couch could be delivered the next day (the 19th). She put me on hold for 30 minutes so she could find a manager to make sure it could be delivered the next day. She got back on the phone and assured me they could deliver it on the 19th and that I should be received an email or phone call that evening with the delivery time. I never received an email or phone call and the couch never came the next day so I called them again but couldn't get through to someone to help me, it would  only let me use the automated system. So I set up a delivery time for this Saturday 3/23 on the automated system. If 3/23 was available, why did the woman on the phone say the next day available was 3/27??

I'm not in the greatest of moods when doing that, so he did the right thing. In there, he struck up a conversation with Christina Harvey, the resident Personal Stylist who explained to him that this was the room where Macys offers a personal stylist service which is a 100% free service.  Yes, you heard me right...FREE.  You will definitely want to buy the clothes she picks out for you though, but there's no obligation.  I took her card and still waited a few months to call her, but I finally made an appointment after many particularly bad choices of some clothes I purchased online.   \n\nI arrived for my appointment and had a consultation about what I like, (still cynical about how this would be because I've ordered from Stitch Fix, and Nordstrom stylists online, and no one could fit me correctly so I would have to send it all back, and I hate shipping stuff too lol).  Then she took a large cart with us and we went shopping.  I didn't have to carry anything.  I didn't have to look through every single item of clothing on every rack.  She knew where she was going and she knew what was available, what would fit my figure, what clothes were the style I asked for, and brought several sizes so I didn't have to get dressed multiple times and go switch something out.  \n\nWe took everything back to the special VIP-like, fancy fitting room that had a FAN in there (I am 50 years old, so not all of you will be so excited about that, but some of you will understand) and you could move around in. I tried everything on, and if it didn't fit, she went right back out and got another size for me. She evaluated the outfits and helped me put them together.  She brought me water.  It was glorious. \n\nI didn't get the \"shopping headache\" I always got before because I had spent 8 hours shopping, trying on item after item in a hot, tiny fitting room. I wasn't angry when I left because I couldn't find the right thing like I used to be.  I got several pieces for work that I feel so amazing in, and now am not so hesitant to go out and see my customers (whereas before I felt frumpy and stayed behind my computer as much as possible).  I honestly have a different take on work now, and feel like I am selling even more because of the air of confidence that wearing such cute and stylish clothes, has given me! \n\nI have worked with Christina twice now, and probably will never order clothes online or shop for myself again- as long as Christina can do this for me!  Oh, and get this- she even got me a discount on EVERYTHING.  Honestly, I hope that Christina knows that this service is so much more than just a personal styling service for clothes.  It honestly really changed my life and I'm grateful to her!", "date": "2019-11-27 14:30:05"}, {"review_id": "zg74h-wUhmWMzOgexmjQSQ", "user_id": "mZM-6gO_JRq2wyFEdGNVKA", "business_id": "5sr7TruB2xvXHGGpoe8OJg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 9, "funny": 4, "cool": 7, "text": "Macys, what's not to like?

We were very excited to get it so fast. We scheduled our delivery.  We got confirmation emails as well as texts saying our couch would be delivered between 11am-1pm and they would call us when they were on their way.  My husband took the day off to be home to get the couch. On the morning of I tracked the shipment and it said it's estimated ETA was 12:30pm.  Around 11am I tracked the shipment again and it now said 2:30pm well outside the 2 hour time frame, but before taking action, I decided to wait it out until it got closer to 1pm.  At 12:54pm we got a call saying the truck broke down and that we would need to call another number to reschedule.

Not surprising, he never got a call back.  I called the next morning to get a confirmation that the delivery fee would be waived and the lady found no record of that anywhere in the documents from the previous calls with my husband. She fortunately waived the delivery fee and emailed me a confirmation of this. My husband was told he could not pick up the merchandise himself because it waived the warranty.  Macy's needs to use their own team to do deliveries instead of outsourcing them because there is a lack of communication and no one knows what is going on because so many people are involved.  \nOh! and to top this all off the representative said if we were to get any additional discounts (she is counting the waived delivery fee as a 10% discount) that exceed 35% it would waive our warranty. What sense does that make? If Macy's or their outsourcing team is screwing up so bad that I need 35% worth of discounts, my warranty should be the same. I haven't screwed up, they have.

Our initial experience was great, we got a rep who helped us pick about $4000 worth of furniture.  Delivery was planned, but we were told we would get a call to schedule our delivery. The next weekend we ordered a mattress and asked for everything to be delivered together. This other rep helped schedule everything to go together less one item because it was back ordered. Fast forward two weeks. No calls, nothing. Except there was something. My card got re-ran again so I had about $8000 in pending transactions. Also, the delivery address was wrong even though I had confirmed it twice. I called and was told that the pending balance  would fall off eventually. I didn't really feel comfortable with that answer so requested the order to be canceled. Our first rep with the $4000 purchase called back and convinced me to re-do the order to the correct address. I agreed and the delivery date was set. Delivery day arrived and only the mattress came. The white glove team was awesome, but none of the other promised items arrived. We called Macy's immediately and were told we would need to wait for a call back. I tried to ask another rep since our original rep was busy, but he immediately said he was too busy to help us. He literally said \"oh we're all kinda busy so you'll just have to wait for a call back\". I was shocked. We tried calling the local Macy's and received the same lack of courtesy. Our rep called back after an hour and said the system was faulty and that our order had been canceled by mistake. By this time we were done. There were no apologies, no accountability, and no courtesy. Please do NOT waste your time with Macy's furniture.

The prices in this section are not good at all, but at least they have it. I actually found better prices for the same items on the Motherhood Maternity website with free shipping. My other beef about the maternity section here is that, instead of being located downstairs with the rest of the women's clothing, it's located upstairs in the children's department.

It's a time for pajamas, pastries, and laziness in preparation for the tryptophan fest later in the afternoon. \n\nSo when swinging by the store I can't help but drag myself through the departments over the two floors as I try to keep my eyes open.  I don't remember this being the case when it was Meier & Frank, a darker, more dismal (remember the forest green carpets and wood paneling?) version of essentially the same merchandise.  But somewhere along the line things changed... or I did. And although my admiration will forever sit with M&F, I am glad to see a few of Macy's touches here.  \n\nThe junior's department is easy to browse.  It's organized, tidy, and lacking both crumpled piles of clothing and overbearing top of the charts pop music.  Prices are on the medium-high level, a little more than other department stores, but nonetheless plain to see on the tags.  I always know how much of my paycheck I'll be blowing, and I've even been surprised to find out on a few occasions that prices are actually lower than marked.  While racks and shelves are often stuffed way too tightly with apparel, it usually means that the sizes I need are there.  \n\nThe same can be said for the petite department, where my short stature can usually find an outfit that doesn't resemble anything belonging to a tiny grandmother.  I like that I can get help if I need it from one of the nice sales associates, but am otherwise left alone to browse.  I'll give credit where credit it due, someone somewhere in this store knows how to put together displays, they're tastefully done and never overpowering in terms of color or pattern.  \n\nMacy's has a signature \"shiny and bright\" look, which can be a little much to take.  While it reminds me more of a sterilized hospital ward instead of a chic hospitable store, maybe that's their trick to getting northwesterners who are used to the gray and overcast skies to perk up and happily shop away.  \n\nI just wish it would work on me... *yawn*", "date": "2009-08-10 03:08:16"}, {"review_id": "vozR6UvhX9qhuKDFaNlUrQ", "user_id": "mzYJUd80NNy-EK4lVeGd0Q", "business_id": "elyX7qWuYUtelyMGOMaRyg", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Stopped by the Macy's Mac makeup counter.

My wife pointed her own name to her. (There is only five customers' names on the entire page!) Then she said, oh, Okay. Let me see you ID, because I do not know if it is you. Then my wife showed her. She came back to the counter and started chatting with other service person and working in front of the check-out machine very slowly. After about 5 minutes waiting, she asked my wife's phone number. My wife said we did not provide the number last time. Then, she looked very angry and upset, and say, hi, you have to give me the phone number! We were extremely shocked by her attitude and the people around were all looking at us. My wife and I were so embarrassed. She then explained that we have to do this, and bala, bala. But we already got very angry and frustrated about her attitude and horrible service. After sharing my experience with my friends who shopped there before, then I knew that she has been very rude to them, too. I am not sure if that is because my friend and us are all Asian people.

Between the huge clearance area to the welcoming, smiling employees, the Natick location has very little to improve itself. \nHere, they've either lost a whole bunch of staff or have changed staff.

Although I find most of the departments unorganized and ridiculously short-staffed, I found myself at this Macy's having to buy a bridal shower gift for a wedding I don't particularly want to go to in the first place (insert low grumble here).  Since Crate & Barrel wasn't offering free shipping from the store, I checked out the registry at Macy's.  \n\nI was rescued by a wedding registry consultant who went completely above and beyond his call of duty to help.  From a distance he watched me go line-by-line through the registry, roll my eyes, snicker, and whisper \"are you #$%^ing kidding me?\" as I reviewed the registry.  He stepped in, asked me how much I wanted to spend on the shower gift and if I wanted to ship it to the bride.  Since I couldn't make the shower, I had to ship it.\n\nHe worked with me and we went line-by-line through the registry and he even let me vent about how the wedding was going to be a complete circus only without a tent for just about an hour.  Seriously, if there was a bottle of red wine involved, he would be my new best friend!  He could have left me on my own to traverse the home and kitchenware section by myself ... he helped me pick out the \"perfect\" gift after talking me out of shipping an empty box full of packing peanuts and purchasing it under the name \"Dixon Cider\" so it would appear on her registry.  (PS - if you don't get the \"Dixon Cider\" name ... just say it out loud a few times). \n\n$51 later after a 15% off coupon, tax, and free shipping... my gift would be shipped including a card.  Easy enough.\n\nSo if you have to purchase a wedding gift and the bride and groom are registered at Macy's, I highly recommend visiting this Macys.  I feel terrible I can't remember the consultant's name, but you can bet your sweet ass I'll be back for the actual wedding gift I'll have to purchase.", "date": "2012-03-19 01:13:05"}, {"review_id": "GlcGDmlQ6ztMJVuIgBolzw", "user_id": "BX8orLQys9jrtYWoiy8ELQ", "business_id": "hANr69iaEs-aEt5zMP1BBQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went shopping yesterday and wanted to buy lipstick for my trip in a couple of weeks.

I ended up going to regular pick-up area since my confirmation email wasn't very clear about where to go, only to find that it wasn't there. To save me from having to run around the store, the employee upstairs called down to confirm that my order was held at fine jewelry (it was), and the people downstairs had everything ready for me in the 30 seconds it took for me to ride the escalator.

Great service! \n\nExhibit 2: I needed to make a return on a few pairs of earrings, so I just went to the nearest service counter.

At the fine-jewelry counter, I was told that although *fine jewelry* did need to be returned there, normal jewelry (i.e. the two less-than-$25 pairs of earrings I had) could be returned at any counter.

Unfortunately, you can only buy Urban Decay eyeliner at Macy's or Sephora in Columbus, and as I didn't feel like going to Polaris, I ended up at Macy's. As soon as I walked inside, it started pouring sideways rain and tornado sirens started going off. It figures. Bad, bad, little communist. This is what you get for spending seventeen dollars on a single stick of eyeliner. \n\nAnyway, I almost immediately bumped into Jazmine, who informed me that I had to go to the corner with a bunch of other people, because apparently we were all going to be sucked up by a twister. I asked her if she was joking, but she was very calm and approachable about the whole matter, and shuffled us all away into the men's Polo section. \n\nOnce it was confirmed that a tornadee was in fact *not* going to git us, we were able to shop again. Jazmine immediately helped me when I arrived back in her section... I had a bunch of questions about different colors and products, and she was really helpful and sweet and well spoken and... everything I would hope for in someone who is selling me quality make up products. I swear to God, this is why I don't go to Sephora anymore. See my review of the Sephora at Polaris... those girls... *shakes fist in air* But at the magical oasis of Macy's (omg), Jazmine even did a lipstick application for me - and the color she picked was awesome. (Urban Decay \"Naked\" - I def bought it...)\n\nHowever, it is almost always my experience that sales people at Macy's (and Nordstrom) are fairly genuine, and this does leagues for their business. I was really just going to buy the eyeliner I came for, but ended up picking up several other products I had been interested in (oh, sinful gluttony!) because I trusted and really liked Jazmine and because I do think good makeup is a quality investment. \n\nI'm telling you, makeup and shoes are my weakness. Despite my politics, I am still a girlie girl. But, I want to be treated respectfully and attentively - and this was exactly my experience at Macy's this week. Thus, they have created a loyal customer (AND I had a similar experience at the Polaris Macy's in the perfume dept. a while back). Not to mention, I got a free makeup bag and a free Philosophy sampler set.

The woman asked I would be using my Macy's card and I said, \"yes, if it is still open I will.

Then the system started asking me more questions that seemed like a crowd card application so I stoped typing in the info and my husband asked, \"are you just having her do a new application?\". The woman assured me no, and after typing in all the info told me my old card was closed and wanted to know if I wanted to apply for a new card. I told her no as my husband and I are trying to build credit to purchase a home. \n\nA week later I get a letter in the mail telling me my application was declined due to not enough information.

I sent an email to complaints, and called their customer service. Customer service *said* they were removing the hit- but I will be ordering my credit report to ensure this was done. For someone who is trying to build their credit and doesn't understand what was done/what their options are this is disgustingly predatory. \n\nDo not trust this location of looking up your Macy's card or give them your business if you are looking to open a new card as they clearly do not respect their customers credit decisions. \n\nAs for the store, if you are liking to pay cash or use another card I do feel as though it has the best selection of any Macy's in the area, so they have that going for them.

It was a cut above the prevalent department stores of the time, like Lazarus or Penney's, and light years beyond my family's mainstay, K-Mart.  (No, we weren't poor -my father was just a cheapskate.)  By the time I hit college, I realized Macy's was no longer that gold standard of the department store shopping experience.  It had become, well, ordinary.  To top it all off, while shopping malls were reasonably cool places to scope potential dates in my teens, they had since become tedious.  Congested.  Disorienting.  Just a general pain in the butt.  And this is Easton, a place I genuinely go out of my way to avoid for all the above reasons.  Just give me a laptop and my Amazon account and let me do my holiday shopping in my pajamas.  Yes, getting older can be so liberating.\n\nMy recent trip to Macy's was the result of an unexpected meltdown of my beloved Cuisinart coffee grinder.  Anyone who knows me knows I start twitching when I am deprived of my coffee, so I immediately did some online price comparisons on a sexy new  Breville grinder, and oddly enough, Macy's price-matched the one I wanted and had one at the beloved Easton store.  I groaned but, knowing caffeine relief was a 20-minute drive away, placed my pickup order and drove out there.\n\nWhat happened next was mostly my fault.  I didn't notice the small print on the website which stated my grinder should be ready for pickup in a few hours.  I scoffed at the admonition, thinking, for years, 15 minutes has been the standard pickup time for even the lesser retailers.  I was certain this was just a written safeguard; what would they need a few hours for?  To manufacture it?  True to their word, when I arrived at the pickup counter 45 minutes after the order, the sleepy-eyed clerk could scarcely look up from inspecting her nails to sigh that it wouldn't be ready for another couple hours.  I had it coming, I suppose.  They warned me and I ignored them.  I grumbled and decided to putz around the mall until then, when she perked up and added, \"Oh, looks like the guy who fills the online orders left for the day.  You can get it tomorrow.\"  My eyes widened.  I wanted to say something, but this was my fault.  I betrayed Amazon and came to Macy's for what I thought would be convenience.  To add insult to injury, by the time I got home, I received an email stating my grinder was ready for pickup.  I guess Sleepy Eyes' crystal ball was a bit off that day.\n\nClearly my two stars is not reflective of the sum total of Macy's, but it's probably more reflective of my general opinion of Macy's (3 stars), minus my experience and their somewhat ridiculous pickup wait policy.  It's a store, folks.  You can drive there, park the car, walk in, and buy stuff.  But I just don't like brick and mortar shopping anymore, and any negative experience like this one is only going to further cement my love affair with Amazon.  But then I'm one step away from telling kids to get off my lawn, so this should come as no surprise.", "date": "2017-01-25 15:50:25"}, {"review_id": "WoqrW3KTl5J0zekWgHaGQA", "user_id": "HPkTf4cTWyV05EDjD69T-g", "business_id": "elyX7qWuYUtelyMGOMaRyg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Be careful of the Bait and Switch practices at Macy's\nTheir discounts look great at first blush... but do not be fooled'\nYou will end up paying MORE than they tell you.\nDo not open an account!

They have a line called Pureness which is more for oily skin and also a line called The Skincare which is for the oily skin with a dry surface.  I use products from both lines.

I complained the store was open until 10pm and after hemming and hawing , finally pointed to the woman in handbags and advised  I should take my items over there to pay. \n\nAs I walked over there,  the woman in handbags saw me and took off in the opposite direction. A male associate in his 20s walking by stopped and told me it was too late, they were closed, and  I couldn't check out. I complained that I had been at the register before closing and he said sorry, you're too late you'll have to come back tomorrow. \n\nA manager arrived, visibly irritated, and pointed out that it was my fault for expecting to check out a minute before close. She finally relented and  found someone to check me out, but the attitude left me with a negative vibe.

It is a huge department store full of anything you really would need while shopping at the mall, however there is zero customer service. You walk in and there are hardly ever any employees. Tons of check out customer service desks but no one to check you out so even if you want to buy something here you have to run around through departments trying to find someone to give your money to. Then when you find someone, odds are they don't want to be there and will show you that through their laziness and unfriendly or unhelpful attitudes. Last weekend my fianc\u00e9 wanted to buy a pair of $90 shoes and there was no one to be found. Plenty of customers and we're all just looking around at each other confused and lost. People needing shoes brought out in their size were left without help in a vacant shoe section. The man we finally tracked down wasn't happy when we asked him to get the shoes in the size we needed (poor him) and took probably 5-8 minutes in the back before finally bringing them out. Because he was the only man to be seen in the store, he was the only one helping us and we were stuck waiting on him when we should have just been in and out. It was excruciating. \n\nAs a teenager I had a pair of $200 jeans from here and went to return them a few months later because they ripped in an odd spot. The ignorant employee asked for my mother's social security number to do the return even though she had the proof of purchase through the Macy's account. Then she tells me that jeans shouldn't last longer than 3-4 months and I wasn't able to return them. It is so asinine I can't even describe how I feel. \n\nCustomer service is horrible, you can never find any employees to even purchase anything, and their policy is terrible. Compare all of this to Nordstrom and it is no contest.

Still looking for the right one, I decided to take it back a few hours later but the clerk turned my husband away stating there was a missing liner, in which at first we didn't understand what she was talking about.\n\nAs a result, I called and spoke to Toy, a manager after I spoke to a supervisor and explained the situation.\n\nHer first question was, \"okay, but did you bother to check to see if there was a liner in it before you bought it, mam\".  I suggested I didn't even know it was supposed to have one since I don't swim and have not worn a swimsuit in a decade.  \n\nShe suggested they have a strict policy and that she would call Easton.  That is something I could do myself, and Easton is 35 minute drive, and theirs is 5 minutes.\n\nI told her I would make a review and she said \"okay\", in a tone that suggest she doesn't care.  I never even received an apology though I could have been stuck with a unsanitary item, as Toy referred to it.  Her excuse was she wasn't the one who sold it to me, but I explained you represent Macy's.\n\nWe have spent thousands of dollars and the year isn't even over yet on furniture including two large dressers and a computer desk, bedding, dresses, men's clothing, brands like Patricia Nash, Ralph Lauren,purses, kitchenware including crystal glasses, sunglasses, costume jewelry, perfume, cologne, shoes and I just bought 6 material girl dresses within two week's just within the last month.\n\nI didn't share this with the manager because I could tell she thought for me it was about money, however it is about feeling like a valued customer.  If I told her this she would say it was bragging instead of viewing my feedback the way a professional manager would, and recognize me as valued customer of Macy's, in which my husband and I are.\n\nI buy makeup frequently from the Mac counter located inside of Macy's.  I had to go to Polaris just to get my face done for my engagement photos because I get ignored majority of the time at the counter waiting, though no one is in line.  I don't get acknowledged because they are doing one face and cant be bothered to ring me out, or even say I'll be with you in a moment.  That is crazy!!!!!!\n\n\nI have had enough of the attitude at this location and will no longer shop here again just because they are not far. They act as if they are doing you a favor for assisting, and come across as mean spirited.  They are ready to argue with you at the drop of a dime too.\n\nNot a fun shopping experience at all.

Then they told us that they will send the watch to the Bulova Company to size the watch and that we had to wait for 7 to 10 days and they will call us back to pick up the watch to the store. The Manager of the store told us that and we accepted and we where happy and treated with excellent Customer service that day! 15 days passed by and no call from the store so we decided to go today to the Macy's store in the Florida Mall to check what happened to the watch! We talked to 2 different employees who sent us to 2 different places who they did not what to do to solve the problem. Finally we saw the Manager who checked in the computer and found out that the watch was in the store since yesterday! She checked in 2 safes and the watch was not there! Then she called by phone and in the floor there were 2 UPS boxes and there was the watch in one of them! She took the watch out of the box and there were no links and the watch was not done anything for sizing ! The watch was sent by the store to remove 2 links and they did nothing in 15 days! That's no way to treat a Customer! Then they did not have any options for fixing the problem! Then my wife asked the manager if we could go to remove the links in another watch store independent from Macy's and pay for it and come back for a refund and they will deduct that from the watch price and she said yes! We went to a watch store near the dining room and payed 21 dollars for sizing the watch! We came back to Macy's for the refund of the money spend for sizing the watch and we had to wait 1 hour for them to give us the money! I will not recommend this store to anyone!

Haven't purchased anything from Macy's furniture wise in decades so I was a bit hesitant but took that leap of faith and away we went.\n\nBlack Friday sales (yeah, I was still out there hunting) tags were everywhere and we did find our set.  Was it as inexpensive as I wanted it to be? No! But am I happy with it? Yes!  Our sales person, Tap, was very helpful and let us wander around the store freely without being hounded (he would either pop up now and again or if I looked in his direction he would come to help) and none of the sales people batted an eye when we were dragging different chairs to different tables to see how combinations would work.\n\nAll of the sales people were friendly and I am happy with the table we bought but why only 3 stars?  Macy's had an odd pricing system with prices for table with two chairs and a bench, table with four chairs and a bench, table with four chairs, etc.  So if there was a price for a combo you wanted you were good but if there wasn't you had to price it separately which could up the price.  Hubs did the math and figured out one combo with one extra piece would be cheaper than another way so good for him!  \n\nBut the biggest reason for the lower rating - the delivery charge.  I believe for four items plus it was $200.00!  GEEZE!!!  And they suckered me into the furniture protection plan of $135.00 which you get back if you don't make a claim in 5 or 7 years (I'm either going to get my money back or use the heck out of that plan).

One star belongs to the nice young lady who told me about the 'pre-sale' on the shoes that we picked up today. The other three stars are missing because they were trampled to death by some very shoddy customer service. \n\nFirst there was a woman sweeping the floor when we came in. She looked up, I gave her a friendly 'hello' smile, she looked back down at the floor without so much as an acknowledgement that we were standing there. The only guess I could make was that they must treat their employees badly, because the older gentleman in women's shoes gave me the impression right off that he  was definitely not enjoying his job and gave my mother-in-law the impression that he did not want to wait on her. Al Bundy syndrome, perhaps? Are they perennially short of help so that the employees become weary of the tiresome 'running to the back' to fetch shoes for their customers?  Perhaps it was because we were dressed in casual clothes (scrubs for me - I practically live in them) rather than the latest fashions, but I got the impression that a few of these folks were not too excited about getting our business. Folks, if you work in retail, remember that a smile costs you nothing. Even if you have to fake it. Some times if you fake it long enough, it actually begins to infect others, and you end up feeling better for it. No customer likes being made to feel like they are bothering the employees by asking for help. They will soon take their business to another store where the employees are a bit more happy to help them. \n\nI have been to places that had customer service so over the top that you felt like you needed to towel their saliva of your lower cleavage. I am not asking for that. But  for crying out loud, at least pretend like you are happy to sell your products to your customers. This exchange of money that follows is what makes your paycheck a reality!\n\nWe were on a complicated mission here. We originally came just to pick up a pair of previously bought shoes (the pre-sale thing). Then I decided since the shoes were on sale, I might as well get a pair for myself, as I spend long hours on my feet. Then my mother-in-law decided my shoes were so nice that she needed a pair just like mine. \n\nChristian was wonderful. He was very understanding with us, especially so in spite of a little stress involving an emergency run to the ladies room right in the middle of his shoe sale. He found the shoes my mother-in-law wanted, and was very kind and compassionate with her. I think Macy's has some good employees. But if they truly want to be the kind of high-end store their prices reflect? They need to weed out the ones who don't want to be there.\n\nFor a store that charges such high dollar prices, the bathrooms are dirtier than many Wal-Mart bathrooms.

First off, the lighting inside of macy's is crap to color match with, and I was told yesterday that if the worker is wearing a white trench coat, that they are certified and trained a lot and are supposed to know what they are doing. That was not the case. I'm more of a light caramel complexion, and I know the lighting is shit in there but this woman color matched me to this dark, cocoa brown, and said it was my shade. I literally looked at her, and told her it was not my shade and told her that I was a WAYYY lighter shade than that, and she said if it didn't match I could bring it back. So I left with that one because I didn't have time for all this nonsense. I tried it that night, just to show my mom, a licensed beautician, what she color matched me to, and the look on her face was priceless. I went back the next day and the same lady was working, and I told her I wasn't that shade and politely told her, I'd color match myself. Do yourself a favor, just go to Sephora or Ulta.

I went and asked another counter if there was a manager I could speak to because this was really uncalled for, turns out, she was the manager, and stopped what she was doing to come help us. At this point, I was already fed up and with the way she had already treated us, ignoring us, and putting on a fake smile, I didn't want her assistance anymore. Never, would I have imagined to be treated like I was not important. What I notice is when I go there in full glam, I get helped, and with no makeup to minimal makeup on, I get treated this way. Terrible service. I would not recommend anyone to going to this Macy's. \n\nLastly, since I walked away from the makeup counter, I walked towards the jewelry and saw a ring that I absolutely had to have, and the woman helping me was just going to have it sent to my house because they didn't have my size in store. My friends co-worker walks in, who is african american, was stared down and looked at in such a way, I was disgusted. He was simply there talking to my friend, and the woman helping me, directed her attention to them, and gave them the dirtiest looks. I could not believe she would do that, especially in front of a customer, who happened to be shopping together. I'm really appalled how bad the service has become at Macy's. I have many stories that make me never want to come back, but simply do because it is so close to where I live. If you want good service, and to not be treated like you're nothing, then go somewhere else.", "date": "2016-05-24 21:26:36"}, {"review_id": "bH6gB1H6iX6NCHMEgLEbzg", "user_id": "AjS3ziM4rpYYbwl0TCAUBA", "business_id": "RX9gcXnI05IMfiinEMmUAA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This Macy's has horrible closing procedures and customer service issues.\n\nI came here with a friend to pick up a prom dress that we had purchased recently about an hour before close.\nWe had parked closer towards the forever21 parking lot on purpose, we knew that that parking lot was a lot closer for us to access the prom dress section and easier to park in especially during the night which was when we were picking up the dress.\nWhen we walked into the store we automatically noticed the lack of registers with cashiers. My friend had a receipt that she had to turn in in order to pick up her dress, and prom is an important day in any woman's life!\nWhen we finally found a cashier, there was a line and the cashier was struggling to find a price for an item and 30 minutes had past.\nWe waited there frustrated watching as other customers left, then the intercom came on with a woman's voice stating that the east exit was closed, and that customers could no longer exit from there.\nBy this time, we were finally being helped and my friend had received her dress.\nWe began to walk towards the exit we came in, expecting it to be open since it is so dark outside and us, being 18 year old women, should be able to exit and get to our car safely.\nBut we noticed that the entire place was empty, and an employee ran past and stated \"Not sure if you can go that way.\" As we went to the door, multiple other customers were being escorted out of the building and the entire place seemed abandoned.\nMy friend and I assumed everyone had already left the store by now, and because the cashiers took a while to find her dress, we were some of the last people in the building.\nAt this time, the lights where off and a woman approached us as we were about to exit the building and rudely tells us that we cannot leave out the door we came in.\nI then asked if she could just let us out since my car was parked right there and we did not feel comfortable walking in the dark. She then proceeded to tell us that we had to walk across the building to the opposite parking lot in order to leave, as switched the lock on the door, locking us in the dark empty building.\nSo she proceeded to follow us all the way across the building, and when we finally got out we had to ask a security guard to escort us across the parking lot because we were alone and uncomfortable.\n\nThis entire situation was so frustrating and humiliating. Rounding up customers at the end of the night as if they are animals is inappropriate and dehumanizing.

If the person(s) checking me out had just done my bill properly, it would have saved me that hour of useless phone arguing and frustration.  \n\nSummary - I won't be returning, because if something else gets messed up on my statement (not a far stretch), I know that there isn't anything to do about it except play a useless game of logical arguments, analogies, and hypotheticals on the phone with someone overseas.

After that,  I tried a different department.  Each time, I asked my question and, each time, I was transferred to what was said to be the extension for general questions. And each time I got the same voice-mail message telling me that I had reached the Executive Offices and suggesting that I leave a message.  Twice, that happened.

Yes, I really do hate Macy's.  I used to sort of like Macy's. They have my Ben Sherman dress shirts and killer sales on suits. It's what drew me in. I needed a suit for my wedding and ASAP! But it all went downhill when the salesman sold me a coat with sleeves way too short for my tailor to work with. I was hard sold into buying it anyway. Silly me! It got worse.\n\nI went in for an exchange but did a return and re-order because they didn't have the size I needed and had to order the replacement online. I wasn't refunded for the return, basically paying for the coat twice. This just confused them. The 800 customer service sends me to the store, the store urges me to call the customer service line. Back and forth about 3 times. As of this writing, round 4 awaits. They also dont seem to keep track of their transaction records on a consistant basis or have access to most of the pertinent information. In addition, their outsourced workforce seems to be limited by not just a language barrier but protocol limitations as well. Frustrating. \n\nAlso, their in-store customer service is not very helpful. As expected of a Mega chain retailer, their knowledge of clothing goes no further than what they have on their sale rack. They were also not very helpful when I tried to figure out who to talk to about clearing my issue up. They were either clueless or rude. Yeah, I know retail jobs suck, but when the company you work for is a giant clusterf*ck it should be no surprise that you'll have pissed off customers. \n\nThanks Macy's. Youre trying to rip me off.

Thus, he was filthy and wearing old clothes and dirty boots, but always spent plenty. One day, a new employee decided he was a bum and decided to treated him very rudely. He lost his job over it....as this prized customer was the conductor of that city's symphony orchestra and lived right around the corner in a 3-story mansion. \n\nI hope this story finds its way to the men's shoe department at Macy's for a certain salesman.

Not in a nice helpful way, but in a rude way inferring that I would steal the dress.  These employees went out of their way and dropped whatever they were doing to run over to me.  Something was definitely NOT right.  I finally reach the belts after being barked at by associates, and was approached by another.  I was comparing belts to the dress at the moment, and she too asked once if I was ready to pay, and I said, \"No, I still want to try this dress on and am looking for a matching belt\".  She then directed me to the clearance section of belts.  Wow...seriously.  I took that to be quite offensive.  Assuming that I can not pay full price.  I just smiled and said, \"Thank you\".  I then at that moment had enough..and put the dress back, because I did not want to be in that environment much longer.  \n\nMacy's lost out on a sale.

So you know it has to be special. \n\nThere was a different lady who helped me in the beginning who seemed to know what she was talking about when I asked her questions. It's my first time buying my boyfriend something unique and I wanted to make it just right. She asked me what kind he wears now (brown, casual, leather strap) and she said right off the bat, go for leather or else he may be uncomfortable.\n\nI wanted to go look some more so I said I'd be back. Stopped by a couple other jewelry spots but in the end came back for the all black Moldovo leather strap one! It was quite a beauty. \n\nHowever, this time it was a different lady and she seemed impatient to sell me it right away without wiping the screen.. without checking for imperfections. One thing that really irked me is the fact they don't carry new ones but only sell the ones on display?

She stated that there will be NO credit check and this will NOT reflect my credit account AT ALL. She said that it is not like applying for another credit card, she is just combining our accounts together. We thought, WOW...that would be cool...but the sales associate never gave us time to think it over...she just went ahead and did the whole thing.....she fast talked us to the point that  we did not know what hit us. \n\nAt the end of the transaction, we walked away thinking that we may have been swindled into opening another account even though she kept reassuring us that she is just combining our accounts. I even told her at the beginning of her fast talk that I wanted to use my gift certificates and she assured me that with the huge discounts and gift certificate that I will end up having more money left over in my gift certificate. Not only did she accomplish her goal of lying to us into opening a joint account, but she also did not let me use my gift certificate because she neglected to tell me that I cannot use the gift certificate when SHE OPENED the account....HOW WAS THAT NOT OPENING AN ACCOUNT??? She seems nice and I am sure she is, but I do not respect someone who lies and fast talks just so she can get customers to open accounts. This is underhanded and despicable, and also the main reason why I shop mostly ONLINE. \n\nA few minutes after we left the fast talking sales associate, my fianc\u00e9 and I found another sales associate named Anais and told her our story because we were feeling very uncomfortable about what had just happened. She was apologetic and very helpful and wanted to truly help. She called a manager right away and a few other associates were EXCEPTIONAL with how they handled this situation. They were very helpful and I am very impressed by the sales associate dressed as Dorothy (I apologize for forgetting your name) because she was empathic and kind. Beth the manager swiftly came by and took care of our problem and tried to reverse the problem. Unfortunately, she cannot reverse the fact that the fast talker opened an account under both our names and most likely this will reflect our credit scores in the future. \n\nOverall, I am giving this store a 4 star rating because the other sales associates (Anais +Dorothy) were very empathetic and helpful. The manager tried her best to help and was sincere about helping us out, and I am not going to let the ONE sales associate spoil it for the other associates that were truly trying to help make my experience here a good one.  I am giving them brownie points for trying to make this right; I just hope in the future they have training for sales associates to not mislead consumers and making sure that customers know exactly when they are signing up for!", "date": "2010-10-30 20:42:27"}, {"review_id": "fnmv1xlfIywW_qUCKYyHYQ", "user_id": "Q_qkQjuuYv78tf6vfYr9Aw", "business_id": "RX9gcXnI05IMfiinEMmUAA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went to Macy's at the Domain on a Saturday.

In other words: I don't know, and I don't care. Go stand in that half hour line and MAYBE it'll be correct. That's how little the employees here about your shopping experience. \n\nWhen I intervened and pointed out to the customer and employee that it wasn't the correct brand, the employee just said, \"Oh.\" but another one nearby actually did her job and looked up the item. \n\nAccording to her, they were sold out.

There is no doubt the upkeep, cleanliness, service and product assortment has declined, same trend with all of the other stores at Lloyd Center, due to its high crime and shoplifting. Many stores have packed up and left (Nordstrom's, Marshall's, Sears) with Macy's being the lone standing anchor store. Please don't leave us!\n\nWhen I want a new dress, top, pair of jeans, sweater, jewelry - whatever - to wear for a specific occasion or as a \"pick me up, Macy's always comes through. Sales happen weekly so I never, ever, pay full price, bringing home treasures at reasonable cost. I particularly like their International Concepts (Inc) brand for unique clothing with a modern edge. \n\nWhen Clinique holds their time annual gift with purchase, I'm there! Also purchase other makeup staples and perfume in this area. The make up artists are always willing to give you a free makeover and it's fun to try and discover colors or applications you never though would wor but do. \n\nFor accessories, they have a small, but decent, selection of affordable everyday jewelry. A fun pair of dangly earrings always brightens my day and can't be passed up! Have purchased several handbags as well, many discounted. \n\nThey now have a *Backstage* section on the third floor which has discounted prices on clothes and housewares. Think of it as a tiny \"Marshall's\" where you can find random treasures.  Picture frames, pillow, kitchen items, towels, clothing, shoes, purses and accessories.\n\nLately it has been challenging finding service help, I think they have cut back on employees. Dressing rooms are now limited - and I get it, I've seen a man walk out of the women's dressing room with suitcase stuffed with clothes , his pit bull along side of him, no one saying a word!\n\nOften I order online and ship to the store. Very convenient; the pick up is on the 2nd floor past the men's section. This way I can try on items I've ordered hole at the store, often I order the item in 2 sizes, and return the one that doesn't work avoiding shipping charges. If you find something in the store but need a size they don't have in stock, they will order for you and ship to your house at no charge. \n\nSo while the appearance and upkeep seems to be suffering (up escalator from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd floor has not been working for months), I still frequent this store several times a month. I like their clothing options and the prices, so I put up the other stuff.

In fact, my experience was so bad, I seriously doubt I'll shop in ANY Macy's ever again.\n\nFor the past month or two, Macy's was having a promotion where, if you bought ANY denim item (and I stress ANY), you'd receive a $10 voucher towards your next purchase. Savvy shopper that I am, I perused the children's section to find items less than $10 to make the deal worth it.\n\nThe woman who waited on me in the children's section tried convincing me that only 2 brands were eligible for this promotion. When I asked to speak with a manager, she relented and accepted all my purchases for the promo. So, either she lied or was too lazy to check. Either way, not good. \n\nIn the process of this transaction, I asked to read the back of the $10 voucher to make sure that I was indeed correct in my understanding of what did and did not count towards the promo. When it came time for me to collect my vouchers, the woman claimed that I did not give her the vouchers back after reading them, basically inferring that I had stolen them. When I insisted that I gave them back, she said they had run out of vouchers, so I could not be given them.  I again asked her to call the manager and then ::poof!:: the vouchers magically appeared with her slamming them on the counter. So, lie #2 with outrageously unprofessional behavior to boot. \n\nThe cherry on top was when I went to the administrative office to file a complaint about their rude employee. It turns out, she never called the manager. She just picked up the phone and pretended to be talking to someone. Unbelievable. \n\nTo make matters worse, I had problems using the $10 vouchers on items that were $9.99. A manager \"did me a favor\" (as he put it) by allowing the vouchers to be used on said items. Apparently, the vouchers are simply a discount on items over $10, but, of course, they never state that on the voucher itself. Typical Macy's scam hidden within a \"deal.\"\n\nAgain, I had to go to the administrative office and plead my case. Not what I had in mind while shopping at a so-called world class department store. \n\nAlso, since I had so many vouchers, a manager said something along the lines of, \"You must've bought a lot of denim, huh?\" slightly inferring that I had stolen them.

How bad could it be on a Thursday around noon?\n\nBAD! VERY BAD! \n\n1. Everything I picked up was on the wrong sized hanger. I picked up a hanger that said small, the shirt was actually a size large. I picked up another small hanger, and the shirt on it was a medium. I checked and EVERY SINGLE SHIRT ON THE RACK WAS ON THE INCORRECT SIZED HANGER. Were they doing this on purpose? Was I being Punk'D? Still a mystery.\n\n2. None of the sale items were correctly marked. We head over to price scanner #1-not working. We walk over to price scanner #2- not working. We head over to price scanner #3 and after you scan your item it takes 37 SECONDS for it to process the bar code. 37 seconds doesn't sound like a long time, but when you have 10 things to scan and a line of 8 people behind you to scan their things (because the other scanners don't work) it is a long time. Trust me.\n\n3. You can never find an employee. Ever. I was starting to think that no one even worked in the clothing departments. There were a ton of them trying to put makeup and perfume on you when you walk in and obnoxious pictures of the Kar-TRASH-ians/Jenners/Whatevers at every makeup counter, but no one near the clothes. Go figure. \n\nRegardless, we found some good sales and we headed over to the fitting rooms- my mother is hopping along slowly. She was getting tired from the walking/standing/hopping with her crutches and we wanted to try the clothes on quickly and leave so she could go elevate her foot at home. We get to the fitting rooms and there is a six person line for the fitting rooms. That means the approximate ten fitting rooms were occupied and there were six more people waiting. I would have normally just waited, but I could see my mother getting tired from standing so long. \n\nWe turned around and headed towards the bathing suit section to try on our clothes there, my mother still hopping along. We get there and there was another line of approximately four people waiting to try on clothes. We contemplated putting our things back and going home, but an employee saw my mother not doing so well and told us to go try our things on in the dresses section, all the way across the store.\n\nWe walk/hop over there and the DRESSING ROOMS ARE CLOSED BECAUSE THEY ARE PAINTING THEM. Firstly, why are you painting your fitting rooms in the middle of the day when there are so many people wanting to try on clothes? Does that really seem like a priority?

I accepted the first delivery and then discovered a large scuff on one of the arms. We called Macy's and they said they would send another sofa. We gave up a Saturday to meet the delivery guys and when the sofa showed up the back cushions were not sewn in properly so one cushion was noticeably out of line with the others. The back cushions are sewn in so it's not like we could adjust them ourselves. So we declined the delivery, which was a good thing because the delivery guy then noticed a small hole on the back of the sofa. We were then told that we would get the \"VIP\" inspection before the next delivery. Why wouldn't everyone get the \"VIP\" inspection in the first place? Anyway, we rescheduled for another Saturday.  That Saturday came and the delivery guys had me come out to look at the sofas before moving them. They unpacked the love seat and I inspected it.  All was good! Then they unpacked the sofa for me to inspect. Scratches! Ugh, there were scratches on the backside of the sofa. Not huge but they were there.  If we were buying used or discount furniture I may have accepted it but a new $3000 sofa set should not have scratches. If we were okay with scratches then we would not have paid for the Accidental Coverage.  I accepted the love seat but did not accept the sofa.  We arranged for another delivery and my girlfriend decided she would miss a day of work. That day came and Macy's called that afternoon to let us know that the sofa did not make it to the warehouse so we would have to reschedule. Here we go again, we rescheduled for another Saturday.  The sofa was delivered as scheduled and we were asked to go outside to watch the delivery guys unpack it.  They unpacked the sofa and the delivery guy immediately says, \"you are not going to like this\".  The back was scuffed. WTF?!?!?! We could not accept it.  The delivery guys have been apologetic. I have watched them unpack and move the furniture.  They have been very careful.\n\nWe are already beyond frustrated with our Macy's experience but the conversation my girlfriend had with their customer service threw me \"over the edge\".  The lady told my girlfriend that they are not going to send us another sofa because they don't think anything has been wrong with them. They are going to send another 3rd party to come inspect the sofa. So now we are dealing with Macy's, Macy's distribution warehouse, the delivery company, and now some furniture inspection company.  RIDICULOUS! \n\nIf the inspection company says it can be patched then we will return the furniture. We should not have to patch brand new $3000 sofas from an supposed upper end retailer.

My mother said we were just going to leave because we had already waited so long and she was being very rude. The lady at the counter didn't even make eye contact with us. She didn't say sorry. She didn't say anything. She just waited for us to leave like we were in her way or something. It was so rude that I said \" and you don't even care, which is the worst part!\" Again, nobody said sorry. And actually I heard an employee make \"you're right\" as we left! I will NEVER return.

The buyers and managers for this location are some of the worst I've ever seen and I travel all over the country.  Macys is usually associated with tasteful clothes and a well organized store.  Over the last couple of years, I've watched the collections in this store degrade to the point that I rarely go in anymore.   Specifically, I'm thinking about the women's section.  I'm not a small person, but I'm not huge either.  I generally dress in the smaller sizes of the plus section. My go-to brands are Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.  Over the last year, this macys has reduced their plus sizes to their house brands only and decreased the size of the section by about 2/3rds.  Methinks the store buyers and management think the entire world is chunky if they are in size 6s.  I personally do not like the house brands because they are low quality and also think plus sized clothes always need ruffles are large prints(shudder).  \n\nWhen I was in there today, the women's section was useless as always and now sandwiched between christmas sales, jackets, and a increasingly large petites section.  I thought this was pretty insane to have the holiday sales merchandise tucked away in an obscure corner of the store on the second floor instead of on the main level where everyone is looking for it.  \n\nIn short, I have no use for this macys location.

They have never let me down when I needed new bedding or kitchen ware and have some great sales. This was my first visit to Macy's in Austin and should have been 4 stars, but and it's a big but, they let me down. I was there on labor day and they were busy but having some good sales. I needed a dress for an appointment I had the next day. I found two really great Liz Claiborne dress marked down to $29 from $119. I tried them on and they fir like a charm. Wow, what a deal. When paying for them with cash, mind you the cashier, let's call her Edna asked me 4 times if I wanted a Macy's credit card. I get that they have to ask and maybe they even bonus if they sign you up. I said no 4 times and had to go into my life story about how I only carry one credit card and that is the reason I have good credit. At that point, let's call her Edna told me that well, when I do get a Macy's card, make sure to do it at a promotional time. I could have sworn I just told her 4 times that I had no desire for a Macy's credit card ever & explained several reasons.  So, I'm off with my dresses and ready to head out. As I walked through the door back into the mall I heard a little beep. I didn't stop because I knew I hadn't taken anything, there were several other people walking through and my 12 year old son had already been nagging that he was ready to go home when I was paying for the dresses which took longer anyways because of the hard pitch for a credit card. When I got home I was re trying on one of the dresses to make sure it matched the shoes I was planning on wearing with it the next day. Much to my dismay it still had the little electronic devise on it. Seeing my distress my machinist friend takes the dress and says don't worry I'll get it off, and he does. Now there is green ink running down my lovely bargain black dress and we are frantically rinsing the dress in the sink. This would have been an almost comic scene were it not for that fact that I am fairly pissed off. If Edna had the time to ask me 4 times if I wanted a Macy's credit card, surely she had the time to take off the electronic thing a ma bob.   Isn't that right up there in priorities with getting payment.? So I grab my cell, call  411 get  through & let the person who answered know what happened as I hang on to my receipt and she immediately says let me put you through to a manager. She transfers me to the black hole   where I wait as the phone rings for 12 minutes and then I just hang up because I have lost patience and know the manager is never picking up.

I went there with the intent to buy a pair of Timberland shoes and while I was there I also found a pair of Sperry topsiders that I wanted to buy also.  However, there appeared to be only two people working in the shoe dept. and they were both helping other customers.

When he finished with the elderly couple he started helping the people who came up after me.  I guess I should have gotten in line.  Not what I normally expect in a shoe dept.  The lines continued to grow so we left without buying the shoes.  We parked by Nordstrom and as we walked by their men's shoe dept. I counted six employees helping customers.  We walked up and someone came up to us almost immediately and asked if they could help.  I bought a pair of topsiders there but they don't carry Timberland so I'll order them from Amazon.

I have been a Lancome lover for 20 plus years. Good skin care is what keeps me on my game! I alternate products from Lancome and products from my dermatologist. \n\nA Lancome makeup artist just happened to be at the store, and I haven't had a makeover since Alex Sanchez in early summer, so this was a treat! I wanted a soft cashmere grey/pink look and wow, I got it! She used the new Teinte Miracle to make my skin look as soft as suede, then lined my eyes in black, close to the lashes, she used Optic all over the lid, and Ceil Du Soir, oooh la la, on the lids and in the crease. Drama was an all over wash of iridescent lilac and black Definicils on my lashes. On my lips she used Bordeaux liner, then pale golden pink It Girl and shimmering Optical Rose La Laque Fever gloss completed the soft look. \n\nHeres an tip from the experts for poutier lips: apply your foundation or powder first, then apply concealer in a lighter shade AROUND your mouth right along the lip line extending outwards about a fourth of an inch. Experiment and see how it works for you. \n\nThe girls at the Lancome counter know their biznazz, you can trust them to make you look good whether understated and elegant or dramatic and rich.

So cool, right?  Well..  when I picked up one of the boxes, I heard a rendition of \"Jingle Bells\" no one who has ordered dinnerware wants to hear.  Upon inspection, I only had 2 place settings in a popular color that needed to be replaced - specifically both of the cereal bowls in the sets and then one of the tea cups.\n\nSo I should've called before in and that's my bad, I admit that- but I knew that Macy's had Fiestaware as kind of a perpetually in-stock item, so I didn't think to check.  Anyway...\n\nSo the place was bustling with people getting in their Christmas shopping.  I thought I could just be in and out with my exchange.  The woman at the counter informs me that THEY do not sell the 5 piece set, so she didn't know what to tell me.  I asked if there was any way they could exhange the individual pieces - and they had the bowls... but not the teacups.  She didn't seem to want to go look for pieces until I asked to speak to a manager- and she was out, coming back with two bowls- no teacup.\n\nShe tells me to step to the side as a manager would be on her way- and she had a line of other people (there were 3 cashiers and about 7 people in line).  So I'm waiting, and there's no manager.  After about 15 minutes, I just call over to her and tell her that I don't mind just returning the teacupless set and getting it at Kohl's where I had seen it earlier.  Only then does she call Highland Mall's Macy's.\n\nIt took Highland Mall's Macy's 3 phone calls to find the product.  All the while, I'm standing to the side.  Finally a manager swings by and the cashier tells the manager that everything's okay because she's seeing if Highland Mall can find their set.\n\nI just want to get out of the mall at this point and Highland Mall finally calls back saying they've reserved me their last 5 piece set and to come and pick it up.\n\nWhile my experience with Highland Mall was FAR more pleasant than Barton Creek- I will avoid this location at all costs because I asked twice for a manager and I never actually had the attention of the manager- and when I asked for a refund, that request wasn't granted.\n\nAt the far end of the day and after a trip to another Macy's, I finally had non-broken Fiestaware- but even after the holidays are over I probably won't be back to this Macys.\n\nTime spent total at Barton Creek Mall with partial exchange: 1 hour", "date": "2010-12-23 01:21:08"}, {"review_id": "dNipo_GQKQX6Pkc80NscRw", "user_id": "cjVFhjSFBZ9vtLBytauhyw", "business_id": "HWti8LzEj6GH19w_HgGpNg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love the fact that you can return almost everything in any department (just no bags or shoes), they have amazing brands for really good prices, you can definitely find great bargains and save tons.", "date": "2017-01-22 22:55:04"}, {"review_id": "of1m4aVpQwlDKYKX91rENg", "user_id": "G-5BxZcF8VA1AX2GRXLEVw", "business_id": "HWti8LzEj6GH19w_HgGpNg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I purchased a sectional sofa a few years ago and was suggested to add the WorryNoMore plan.

I hope Zoila no longer works for you as I clearly witnessed she has no customer service skills. \n\nREVIEW FOR ZOILA IN WOMENS DEPT ONLY*\nI went Christmas Shopping and stopped here for some purchases. I found two items on clearance that I wanted to buy.I had bought clothes for black Friday and received a coupon that said I could use it on select clearance items. I go to the counter.. the lady said I couldn't use it on the items. She had already rung up my items so I told her I really wanted to use the coupon so I would go find another item so I could use it. She tells me, \"OK well lets finish this transaction first.\" I told her I didn't want to do that as I wanted to buy my whole purchase at once because I didn't want to pay tax twice. She then explains that Im wrong and says some math crap that I didn't care or need to here. I AM THE CUSTOMER! Why is she arguing with me about doing my transaction all at once!!? Anyway, I stood my ground and told her I was going to look for another item so I could purchase all at once.  I went to go look and couldn't find anything I needed and remembered I had to be somewhere. On my way back to the counter to purchase the items I looked at the coupon closely that said I could use it on select clearance items. I thought Id give it a try and ask her if I could use it since that's what the coupon said and earlier she didn't even look at my coupon. When I turn the counter to check out she sees I have my coupon out and goes nuts. I seriously just said these words, \"I was wondering if my coupon..\" before I can finish my sentence she stops me, puts both her hands on her head pulls her hair and says, \"UGH You can not use the coupon! I told you that earlier. Don't you think if you could use it I would add it to your purchase. YOU HAVE LAST ACT that means coupons can not be used! What do you not understand?\" MIND you... midway thru her sentence she raises her tone and starts speaking IN SPANISH! I am a Hispanic lady who knows Spanish... BUT WHY IS YOUR EMPLOYEE speaking to me in Spanish if I addresses her in English. She doesn't know if I speak it... She was talking to me like a was child. She was VERY unprofessional pulling her hair puffing and speaking to me in this manner! I did nothing. She could've told me kindly, \"No ma'am Im sorry the coupon cant be used.\" AND I would've understood! No problems there. I was just confused by the words on the coupon that told me I could use it! I then told her that I was a customer and she had no right speaking to me like that.. as I was talking she interrupts me AGAIN and says \"Do you want it or not? Do you want it or not?\" Pointing to my items. She was trying to hush me! She wasn't apologetic. She was a ghetto employee who does not care how she represents the COMPANY MACYS. I am appalled I was treated this way. I asked for a manager. When I did, she turned to her neighbor employee and said, \"Call AMY.\" I didn't appreciate that. She wanted this so called \"Amy\" girl to come... for all I know this is a employee friend? No not ok. I told her, no.. I want a manager who is not AMY. After a few minutes a man named David came. I told him everything and the firs thing out his mouth was.. Please tell us about your experience via online that's how my manager will know. I used to be in management.. he did not apologize or say.. \"That is not ok.. \" Nothing! The girl told me her name was something like Zoila.

I came into Macy's to return a gift I received in the mail. I brought the receipt I received in the box. When I tried to return it, their employee Jeff (wonderful by the way!) was having problems with the barcode on the receipt not ringing up. He tried multiple times and different ways to no avail. When he called the manager, Jose was also unable to find a resolution with the barcode so he told him to treat the return as if I didn't have a receipt. If you do not know, Macy's has the worst return policy if you do not have a receipt. They take the lowest price that the item was in the last 6 MONTHS and give you that value. The lowest price on my item was $28, but was currently selling for $100. That is a BIG difference. Jeff refused to do my return for $28 and thus Jose came over to try and \"help\". Jose said he went through Macy's records to find our specific order and couldn't find it. He then kept explaining that he wasn't finding anything, but insisted on showing us what he was doing. Eventually he did find the order, and what do you know, my friend ended up paying $100. \n\nWe ended up finally getting the correct amount returned to us in a gift card 45 minutes later. My entire problem with all of this, and what I kept saying to Jose, was that this wasn't our fault but we were being treated as if it was. We were following their rules by bringing our receipt so we could avoid their bogus exchange policy, but he kept treating us as if we were wrong. I told him this is terrible customer service to not give the correct amount to your customer and basically pocket the $72. The receipt was Macy's fault, not ours. No effort was made on his part to make us happy, and he didn't even attempt to. He had a fake smile on his face the entire time and kept saying \"sorry, I can't find the return in our system\". I have the receipt! What more do you want!? Do not treat me with such blatant disrespect, and do NOT tell me that your crazy exchange policy is \"lenient\".

Went here today and they happen to have a lot of clearance shoes, however I had my baby with me and couldn't really maneuver my stroller through the clearance isles because they were too narrow. I found a boot I liked and just needed the matching one, so i went to the desk to get an associate. In front of me were 2 ladies who looked very annoyed and said they had been waiting as well for shoes. The associate was a young boy, however he had no pep in his step, walked slowly, didn't go out of his way to ask if you needed anything, etc. Actually felt as if he was annoyed to be there. When it became my turn he said the barcode wouldn't scan, but he would go check in the back. He came back almost immediately & never said a thing, was taking shoes to other people, etc. I thought maybe there was another associate working the back trying to find it & that it was just taking a while because they had to manually try & find it with no barcode reference. Literally 15 minutes went by before I got up & approached him & he acted like he didn't even remember me & when I reminded him of the situation he nonchalantly said, \"ohhh, yeah we couldn't find it\".", "date": "2019-03-25 03:21:25"}, {"review_id": "M-1vPYxyhFXsjV1oNbhwRQ", "user_id": "gd0oSRTWAyHnXPVg6fwacQ", "business_id": "Km8-4IsJ0YfuMk-7abuqKg", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Stopped here to pick up my Calvin Kleins.

I waited almost five minutes to get a cashiers attention to come to their register. As I stood at the register my section became a ghost town. \n\nWhen the lady finally showed up there was no apology for the wait and she seemed more interested in trying to sell me on signing up for their store branded credit card than getting me out the door or minimizing my irritation.

I understand they were trained to push the credit cards but I had two items and check out took over ten minutes.\n\nMacy's has a lot of different brands and their prices are a little on the high side but they usually have some good sales and their clearence section has some really good deals.

I had simple expectations of purchasing quality furniture and having it delivered in perfect condition on time, but unfortunately that's not the way it went.  \n\nI was given verbal confirmation over the phone with someone at Macy's that my furniture would be delivered on Friday, October 6th if I got in early enough on Wednesday to place the order. I changed my move-in date to a day earlier to accommodate delivery and paid an extra $36 to do so. This way my furniture would be there when my mother arrived on the 7th from out of state for the week. Went in to purchase my furniture and was told unfortunately delivery wouldn't be possible for Friday. \n\nSo I went ahead with the next soonest delivery date which was the following Friday the 13th. I wouldn't have any place to sit for the entire first week of living in my apartment so I was rather upset. I decided not to make a fuss and just wait. The following Wednesday before delivery they said they couldn't deliver that week because the accent chair wasn't at the warehouse and was still in Atlanta. I said I still wanted my sofa delivered as scheduled because I HAVE NO PLACE TO SIT DOWN. They said the sofa couldn't be delivered either because the accent chair wasn't ready. I guess this would've been AN INCONVENIENCE for THEM to have to deliver twice because of THEIR MISTAKE. \n\nIt was an inconvenience for me to have to take off of work on the 13th. It was an inconvenience to have take off of work the 20th when the furniture was delivered. The delivery guys forgot the 'red carpet' they roll out to protect your floors. And I was awful nervous hearing all the banging and \"I thought you had it\" as they were coming up the three flights of stairs. The furniture looked fine upon first inspection, the guy was super friendly and they didn't seem to make a mess so I signed for it. \n\nNow that I've had a chance to really inspect the furniture there is a corner of the armrest that is slightly dented and missing finish. The front left leg has a scuff and is missing the glider on the bottom. The chair rocks and isn't supposed to. All these things are minor inconveniences by themselves, but all added up have made for a really shitty experience. My saleswoman suggested to call for an inconvenience credit. I did. She offered me $25. I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but WHAT A FUCKING JOKE! And they'll come to fix the furniture, but it has to be on a Thursday. And no you can't schedule a time because they set their own schedule the day before. So yea, I'll have to take off another day of work if I want that to happen. I'm not happy with my experience buying furniture from Macy's.

So I did that and received an email saying it was ready for pickup.  I went to Macy's and luckily parked at the entrance to the store pickup & return counter. The staff member scanned the barcode from my email and checked my ID. He then went to the back to hand me a UPS package.  So why not have UPS just deliver it to my home versus the store?\n\n2) Since I was at Macy's anyway I needed a new down pillow for my wife.  I went upstairs to the pillow department.  Macy's was pushing their Hotel Collection brand and selected one. The pillow was on sale but could get an extra discount if I pick it up 5 days later. At first though it had to be ordered but the sales guy grabbed it off the shelf and tagged it like checking in luggage at the airport.  When I return I don't go to the store pickup but return back to the pillow department. All this does not make sense where the number one rule in sales is to get rid of merchandise in the store where it is taking up space, and space is money. I went ahead and purchased it since Macy's not to far from my home and was a great price for a goose down pillow with the pillow cover. \n\n3) The store exterior and interior is still stuck in the 1980s.  It needs a major overhaul and perhaps add a restaurant like Nordstrom where this property has an excellent view of downtown Austin. There is way too much merchandise in the store and most of it not organized.  This store needs to thin out departments where I would start first with furniture and knock down some walls to make it feel more open. \n\nThe jacket which is a Macy's brand Style & Co is well made is very nice and the pillow seen at the store should be comfortable from reading goods reviews.", "date": "2019-01-25 23:47:36"}, {"review_id": "QW5hSn3Z4ZO6K1fzHquUNg", "user_id": "K-HQZgwTXWyO8nfVlTdoOg", "business_id": "HWti8LzEj6GH19w_HgGpNg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This review is for the furniture department only.

My wife is very cautious when it come to Covid so it was nice to shop \"alone\" for a bit. \nThen the time comes to pay. \n We thought we would try getting there \"12 month credit thing\" but no dice. \nRude thing though was Starla kept calling my wife \"Theresa\", even while she had my wife's ID in her hand. Rather rude on a bigger purchase but I let it go. Then, she kept asking for info she had in her hand while starting the upsell. \nFirst the upsell for \"free\" delivery. Then being called another persons name for most of the transaction. Talk about rude. Then comes $125 \"mattress protector\" upsell. \nShe kept wording it like if we don't buy this mattress protector we wouldn't get the manufacture's 10 year warranty! \"If you get this mattress protector it will get you your ten year warranty or we'll clean the stain because your warranty is null and void if they find a stain\". My wife said so, \"If we get this mattress protector, we will be covered with a ten year warranty and she said, yes.\" So a slight bit of sales trickery by making my wife think that we needed this FOR THE WARRANTY. The more I tried to politely call BS the more she dug in. I know the mattress has a ten year but the way Starla kept wording it, it was like we \"had to\" have it this mattress protector. \nI get it. When I worked mattress sales the protector money was ours. So dog eat dog. I understand that, but it ain't cool. Why I got out of sales. \nMy wife \"Theresa\" (haha) said \"I don't wanna be rude but this is overwhelming and she stormed out.

In fact it is the epitome of a useless urban wasteland desperately in need of a renewal project.  Now that Filene's basement is gone there is really no reason to go to Downtown Crossing, save for the fact that the H&M location here is the only one with things worth buying and there ARE a few good jewelry stores if you are looking for estate pieces.  That said, I suppose I should not have expected anything spectacular from a store as awful as Macy's in the first place, especially when the store is dumped in the armpit of Boston.  All Macy's locations suck, this one just sucks the most.  \n\nMy burning anger started last Christmas season when I went in there last minute so my bf could buy a box of Godiva chocolates as a gift to be given later than night.  Mind you, it was cold and we had just started a day of shopping that was likely to continue for several more hours.  After purchasing his chocolates we were given a cheap, plastic, grocerystore -type bag to carry them around the city in for an entire day.  Whilst this may be acceptable for a $4.99 clearance t-shirt, it is not so for a $50 box of chocolates.  Also, I normally would just be polite and pay it no mind however the fact that we had to carry a heavy box of chocolates around all day in the cold prompted me to ask another associate for a proper shopping bag (the kind with the rope handles that you can put on your arm rather than one that requires holding as the plastic 'straps' get thinner and thinner under the weight of the bag before they cut off circulation in your fingers).  No big deal right?  I was polite and as a paying customer I simply asked for a favour.  WRONG!  The associate at the counter that had the shopping bags told me that I could not have one.  I believe the exact words were: \"I can't give those out because security instructed us only to give bags to customers\".  I politely reminded the girl that I WAS in fact a customer and proceeded to pull out my receipt to show her as I explained why I wanted a good bag in the first place.  Her reply?: \"Well you already got a bag so I can't give you another one.\"  I said I would give her the plastic bag back in exchange but she wouldn't budge!  I ended up going to another counter and getting a bag and when I told the lady the story she said \"well the associate was right.  I shouldn't be giving this to you but I'm feeling nice tonight.\"  WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS?  I don't understand why ANYONE would shop at this place when you can go to Nordstroms and get half of the same stuff and actually feel like you are wanted there.  I understand everyone has bad days but this seemed to be more of a company policy rather than one individual being rude.\n\nThe hatred spawned a lovechild last weekend when I went in there because I badly had to go to the restroom (and Boston has a  lack of public restrooms).  We went downstairs to the basement level only to be told \"this is only the women's restroom\".  I asked where the mensroom was and the guy said \"restrooms are under renovation so there is no mensroom in the whole store\".  What kind of ridiculousness is this?  Why do women get a makeshift restroom in the basement but not men?  Not only is this sexist and unacceptable, but when I (having HAD IT with this store by now) said \"this is why I hate coming to this store\" the salesman replied \"well there are other Macy's with restrooms\".  HOW STUPID!!  How is that going to help me in any way at the moment?  I suppose I'll just jaunt over to Natick or to Braintree just to go to Macy's restroom.  Stupid, stupid man!\n\nSo these experiences added to the fact that 75% of what is in the store is junk (and the other 25% you could buy at Nordstroms) prompted me to write this review.  I hate giving places a 1-star review but as the old saying goes \"fool me once, shame on you...fool me twice, shame on me\".  I will NEVER buy something from this store again.  In my opinion they are just as bad as a Walmart (albeit with higher prices) in the respect that they 1. have awful service, 2. are too big of a company for their own good, and 3. try to put all the good, family-run places out of business.

Today, however, I received some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. \nI came in around noonish today to make a return where half of the payment from the item derived from an Ez-Exchange card, and the rest of the payment was made on my Skylight card (as a prior Macy's employee myself this was the card that they supplied to deposit my paycheck). When I did my return, the sales associate (I don't know her name, she wasn't wearing a name tag so I'm not sure if she was part of management or not) quickly snapped at me and stated that if I didn't have the \"gift Visa\" she wouldn't be able to put the part of the return that I wanted back on my card. Remembering that I never paid with a Visa gift card, I was a little confused and took a few seconds to try and figure out what that form of payment could be. Seeing that it was my Skylight card, I grabbed it and said I would like to still put that portion of the return back on my card. Yes, I am aware it would have been easier for the associate to just give me another Ez-Exchange card with the total amount, but I did truly need the fraction of the return to be put back onto my card (which really only takes a few extra seconds). Her attitude did little to hide her frustration with me and then in the most condescending way imaginable told me to have a good rest of my day. The manner in which she addressed me was something I can't even put into words-- just obvious irritation and very condescending. I couldn't even look her in the eye at the end of the transaction and was pretty much speechless. \nI get that people have bad days, and I'd like to think that this was the case for her.

Or else maybe it's just that I realized that considering my aversion to gold-tone hardware and cheap synthetic prints, I'm better off upstairs in the contemporary collections than down in the dungeon where they keep the juniors.\n\nThe selection of upper-scale brands isn't as good as at Lord and Taylor, but it's fairly decent nonetheless.  They carry my eternal favorite, Free People, as well as my recently beloved French Connection, and frequently have sales on both that render the lines much cheaper than if you were to shop at their respective boutiques.  In fact, confession: it is extremely rare that I will shop from any rack that does not have a 75% off sign on it.  If you go at strategic sale times of year, there will be 75% off racks literally crammed with good brands.  You might have wade through them, but accept that that is the nature of the bargain hunt and get on with it.\n\nMy fondness for Macy's was actually cemented this past weekend, when I found a gunmetal satin shift dress with distressed sequins from French Connection.  The tag was missing, but there was a sale sticker that said it was on sale for $99 from $198.  It was on an 80% off rack.  There were no others.  And it was five minutes until close.  I wanted it.  Badly.  But only if it was 80% off.  The girl at the register rifled through the sale rack with me for a few minutes looking for something similarly priced to scan.  Finally, exasperated and ready to go home, she grabbed another dress at random, scanned it into the register, and showed me the amount on the screen.  \"Does that look good?\" she asked.  The screen said $21.60.  Um, yeah, it looked pretty damn good.  And the dress, fatefully, was mine.\n\nAlso, for the ladies: Macy's didn't used to have a MAC counter.  The Filene's MAC counter was hands-down the best MAC counter in the Boston area  - that is to say, the one with the most  talented staff.  When Filene's closed, its MAC staff was split between the MAC store on Newbury Street and the new counter at Macy's  Macy's got all the best people, because the counter manager there is in charge of all the hiring for the Boston area.  So the MAC counter at Macy's is, quite literally, the best of the best.

Just smashing. When I go to a department store and drop a few hundred dollars, what I want is to be treated gruffly and then have my purchase messed up. Why not? I'm sure you get so many customers that you don't actually care about my experience...\n\nSo my boyfriend and I stopped in here on a dress hunt not long ago. He needed a new suit and shoes and I need a new spring wardrobe for my job as well. I split ways with him at the jewelry counter and decided to meet back up in an hour.\n\nI proceeded to peruse the upstairs selection of questionable women's fashion for some time before I was approached. I got a few unpleasant looks from staff, likely because I had purple hair at the time, but I brushed it off. In department store settings, I prefer to browse unattended.\n\nThe issue came when I went to try on a couple of things. I was told I couldn't bring my bag into the dressing room and would need to leave it in the seating room sitting area, unattended, while I tried things on. This has never happened to me before, and despite really liking one of the dresses I was holding, I handed all my items to the sales associate and walked away.\n\nMy boyfriend had a much better experience with his suit and shoes. That is, until we brought them home. To be fair, he should have checked the clothes that night, as he had a major interview the next day. The next morning, sure enough, they've given him someone else's suit, several sizes too small, with a different pickup slip, different sales associate's name on the slip than the one he worked with and that person's Macy's card number written out on the tag.\n\nFortunately, he was able to throw another outfit together, but the staff were gruff and almost accusative when we did the return. I'm sorry, should we have made YOUR job easier, Macy's? \n\nI'm never shopping here again.\n\nOne star for the shoe associate, though. He was friendly, funny and very helpful in getting my boyfriend a pair of shoes that actually, finally have laces. :P", "date": "2013-04-17 23:36:39"}, {"review_id": "zyLlcz0QrcT9CzM3coFN4w", "user_id": "g9eEGOJ-_9OQlOkXiRo9eA", "business_id": "2kKLOPKZw4WJzN3MNYkFVA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "How Macy's ruined my party\n\nWith new house comes new table.

No customer service reps (CSRs) are there.  \"OK\", I think to myself:  \"they must have gotten called away.\"  I walk down to the Clarins counter.  The woman working the counter doesn't notice me at first because she's squatted down behind the counter on her phone playing Flappy Bird or something.  I ask her to find the Inglot CSRs and tell them I'd like to be helped.  She agrees so to do and she walks into a back room.  She spends about thirty seconds back there and comes out telling me the women will be out in five minutes.\n\nSo I go back to the Inglot counter and wait...and wait...and wait.  I am thinking about walking out, but it's not like I took the T from Park Avenue to get here. So I wait some more, until I can't take it anymore.  I return to the Clarins counter, (where the saleswoman was AGAIN ducked down behind the counter on her phone) and ask her to remind the Inglot women I am waiting for them.   This time I follow her to the back room and look in on her talking to women in the back room.  This is when I notice one woman is curling the other's hair with a curling iron.     Clarins woman emerges from the back room and tells me it would be better if I come back tomorrow for help at Inglot..\n\nReally? \n\nSo you're telling me to make a two hour plus trip tomorrow because CSRs are getting dolled up to hit that nae nae at the club on company. time.

I went to SIX different cosmetics counters asking for the Inglot CSR's names. Interestingly enough, nobody knew who they were.  Hm.   I got the  distinct feeling I was being stonewalled.   Finally I came upon a CSR who knew the names of the women I was talking about and told me what they were.  When I asked her if she would ask the Inglot CSRs to help at the counter, SHE suggested straightaway I come back tomorrow.  If I wanted to shop tomorrow, I would have saved my trip for tomorrow.  Mind you, this was around eight and Macy's doesn't shut until ten pm.\n\nEssentially, the whole trip was a waste of my time, money and gas because Inglot CSRs are not having something as trivial as a job come between them and their hairspray.

Sales prices were nice, delivery was free if you spent a certain amount (I think $900, free delivery and taking away of the old mattress) and if you had a Macy's card, they were offering 0 down, 12 months zero interest.\n\nWe were greeted and helped by Pat, who was a very nice sales lady. We test rested a LOT of beds here. Decided Seally and Serta were off the list and really liked the Simmon's beds.

First of all there was one associate for about 4-5 customers milling around the suit department.  You would think that a high priced item like suits would have plenty of sales associates.  Second the aisles are very tight and the amount of items placed on the rack make it almost impossible to shop.  Third, hard to believe, but almost nothing is organized by size.

(Good luck actually finding something to buy in the store while browsing... everything is so disorganized!) I've had some pretty unpleasant experiences here over the past ten months. Here are my complaints and experiences about this location: \n\n1) Today, I saw a brown mouse scurry across the floor on the second floor Women's department. It ran from underneath a customer's service desk into an inventory room! This was my first time ever seeing a mouse in a department store, and I have been to department stores located in much worse neighborhoods than this location. Also, who wants to pay potentially hundreds of dollars for articles of clothing that may have had contact with mice at some point? \n\n2) Whenever I return something to this location, the people at customer's service often act like making a return is a weird thing to do. They make comments or tell me to look around the store to find similar articles of clothing. It personally doesn't bother me at all, but shouldn't they be used to customers making returns, since so many people shop at Macy's? I've never had a problem with an article not being accepted or a return not going through, though. \n\n3) They need to hire more cashiers who speak better English, or alternatively, they need to hire more cashiers who are multilingual. This becomes an issue when cashiers who don't speak English well interact with customers who similarly don't speak English well. For instance, the language barriers from both sides of the cash register create situations where cashiers will spend ten minutes trying to determine whether the customers have a Macy's card or would like to sign up for one, which makes everyone else in line wait for a really long time. This becomes especially annoying when it happens in the single customer service desk that functions as the place to pick up online purchases, so customers must wait for the issue to be resolved. If they hire more multilingual people to work in customer service, they would be able to resolve such issues more quickly. \n\nOverall, I really am not a fan of this Macy's location.", "date": "2015-06-17 19:54:58"}, {"review_id": "UK8rM3AXqY7jlg8fEGn6-w", "user_id": "io1j7q4JBInkOPo4kw4lVw", "business_id": "6bliT6JzYewOFPEKk6-NXw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Conveniently located Macy's!

Consider this: Me, 6:30 PM after work on a Wednesday night, in desperate need of heels for a wedding that I'm leaving for on Friday. I'm in the shoe department. The shoe department is, quite literally, a war zone. Makes Filene's Basement look ORDERLY by comparison. I sift through the rubble that is the sale shoe racks. I find a cute pair of heels in a funky shade of purple. Oh, the size 6 feels like it may be a touch small. The size 7 feels a touch large. Hard to be sure with just one shoe, right? I bring both to the shoe agent and ask if he can please get me both the size 6 and 7 from the stock room to try on, and also, can he check if there might be a pair of 6 1/2? His actual answer is: Are you kidding?! That's what he said to me. And he made a chortling sound at me! I answered back, Um, YES, are YOU kidding? (ha, game on jerk-o!) He asks why can't I just try on the size 6 and 7 I'm holding? I point out that, while I may be freak (but I think NOT) my two feet are NOT exactly the same size and I need to in fact try BOTH shoes on to be sure! He then adds that there's no WAY there are a pair of size 6.5 out back, since everything we have is out on the sales racks. Huh, really? So since I found a size NINE and a size FIVE on the racks labeled for size SIX, might it be impossible to assume that they MAY have a size 6.5 heel in some random spot on the ridiculously messy sales floor that I missed?? I mean, I tried picking through the other racks to see, but come on, I don't have all night! He refused to even acknowledge the possibility- wouldn't look out back for a 6.5, too much to ask. Seriously people? I ended up buying the size 6, and you know what? This S.O.B. got a commission on it! A week later, I returned them because I found a more comfortable pair at DSW the next night!

I assumed that because they were on the card and looked right that they were a Size 9. NOPE. I called the store because I was going away and they told me they would credit me back the $20.00. Never happened. So now I own two different sized flip-flops. Perfect.\n\nThen I got engaged and my fiance and I stopped by to set-up our Registry in-store after work. We never went back. Why? Because I don't feel like I need an appointment with someone selling me \"aspirational china\" or helping me to choose a chip-and-dip. I live in an apartment, I don't need luggage, a pants press, a bed, and I bought my Wedgewood china at a consignment store. The woman kept saying to my fiance, \"Wow, he looks really disinterested!\" \"Oh boy, yeah, this is boring stuff for you, right?\" He's a 28 year-old attorney, china patterns and salad utensils are not his vocation. He'd rather eat glass. True story.\n\nBut the real problem in there (besides the piles of clothes, complete disorganization, stained carpets, and just general horrors) Today I went to pick-up an online order there (mascara, basic, right?). NOPE. See, Macy's has this incredibly convenient, \"Order Online and Pick-Up In Store\" function, but I imagine in other Macy's it's a SEPARATE desk, you know, kind of like Customer Service? But it's not. It's on the second floor in the middle of Ladies Apparel. I have spent more time in line at this Macy's while people BARGAIN (how many coupons does Macy's send me every week? Everything in that store is 40% off) over crap and try and bait and switch. So I spent 15 minutes in line before two people managed to get ahead of me to the other register at that counter and I gave-up. I went downstairs to Lancome and bought my mascara from a lovely girl. She helpfully informed me that Macy's doesn't actually HAVE a Customer Service desk per say... what kind of operation is this?\n\nThen I left and I called Macy's customer service which took two attempts because God forbid they should be helpful. Talked to a fantastic woman who connected me to the Boston store where, naturally, the fun began again. It took two tries through the menu to get the operator. The operator took a minute to answer and then connected me with someone in the Executive Office who was less than helpful. She transferred me to someone who picked-up the phone after 15, yes, 15, rings and who couldn't. understand. what. I. was. saying. \"I want to cancel an in store pick-up.\" I'm not sure how difficult that concept is, but the woman kept asking me, \"What do you want?\" so I just hung-up.\n\nThankfully the order gets canceled on 1/13/15 which is great because I will never. ever. shop there again. That store is an absolute disgrace. I don't know why someone at Macy's HQ hasn't stepped in and fixed that hellhole.

Even though you can get almost anything at 80% off at any given time.\n\n1. What a mess. I went there on a random Sunday to see if they had any good post-holiday deals. Open boxes strewn about, sale signs all over the floor, chaos, no one around. \n2. Where are all the salespeople? Why did I have to wait 20 minutes to buy a sandwich maker when there were only 2 people in front of me? Why do the transactions take 10 minutes each?\n3. The cool casual name-brand sweater I bought for my bf on clearance for like $20 (originally $75 or something) ripped, after he wore it...once. \n4. Similarly, their store-brand clothing in the women's section SUCKS. The tags are painful! I almost broke out in hives from my outfit today. And, it pilled after one wear (little sweater set). Wha!?!\n5. Their direct mail kills more trees than the daily paper does, I'm sure. Stop sending me shit. Seriously. Stop.\n6. Here is where it gets wonderful. I went to use a 20% off thing w/my Macy's card. So here I am like a boob trying to make a purchase and looking like I have a spending problem because my card won't go through. When the lady on the phone tells me this in the store, I ask her to please approve this txn as I had just submitted a payment in full 2 days earlier. It still wasn't in her system she says...and then informs me that \"In addition, you are over your limit. You have been for 3 months.\" I was FLOORED. They had halved my limit and never informed me. I closed my card on the spot. \n7. The saga from #6 continues as I use the 20% of w/my Amex. Then go downstairs to use the coupon again as I had all day to use it. This new register would not let me use the Amex even though there were no restrictions on the coupon and I...had...just...used...it...2...min...ago. Took 3 salespeople and calls around to figure that out until they just did it manually. I almost seriously started crying and screaming. \n\nI really could go on but this might be my longest review so I'll stop.

Macy's had used a web-only SKU on the packing slip, so the sales associate couldn't figure out how to let me exchange the towels for an identical set in a different shade. He offered me two options: Make the exchange and pay a huge price difference, or outright return the unwanted towels for a few dollars (literally; he offered me under ten dollars for about $150 worth of new towels). Basically, Macy's mistake was going to be my loss.\n\nI was so frustrated by this situation that I thought, screw it, and went to leave.

However, when I got home, my glasses were back to its original form (one temple higher than the other)!  \n\nSo I went to another Sunglass Hut and spoke with a sale person about the issue and he immediately says that my glasses should lay flat on even surface to begin with and then adjust accordingly if need be.  So he did it the right way by heating up my glasses first so that it can be adjusted easily without breaking it and once adjusted he says it would be permanent and that the temples should lay flat on even surface.  I'm so glad I went to another location to get it adjusted as I really like the glasses and wouldn't want to have to return them.\n\nThe sales woman at the Sunglass Hut counter at Macy's downtown Boston location was so not helpful and lazy, she obviously didn't want to assist me at all!

It took a month to get them to re-deliver another chair and that is when  the real fun started.\n\nThe delivery people arrived. They failed to hand over the Macy's 5 Star Service Paper describing how they would be careful and use precautions to protect my floor and other belongings. They failed to wear shoe protectors.\n\nThe attempted to disassemble the first chair. They tipped it forward. I offered them a blanket to protect the floor. They declined and stated they were professions and had been doing this for a long time so did not need the blanket. They gave up on disassembling the first chair and brought in the parts to the second chair. \n\nI offered them a blanket again to set up the chair on to protect the floor. They again declined the blanket. I then provided the blanket and MADE them work on top of it to assemble the new chair. They failed to follow the instructions to assemble the chair. The instructions state that the back should be installed, the Velcro flap on the recliner should be attached and then the feet should be attached. I had to make them follow the instructions. I thought all was well since the new chair was now set up on the blanket I had forced them to use and no damage had been done to the floor.\n\nUpon completing the assembly of the new chair, they proceeded to work on removing the old chair. Since the back would not come off the first chair they had to awkwardly try to recline the chair and then lift it in the reclined position to get it out of the door.\n\nAS THEY LIFTED AND ROTATED THE FIRST CHAIR, MY HEART SANK. That horrible noise was made when you hear two pieces of wood scraping together. I knew either the floor or the first chair was damaged, but not sure which.\n\nDid the floor win? \n\nDid the leg of the chair win?\n\nThe leg of the chair being returned won. \n\nThe 1 year old maple floor lost, so I have a new 6 inch long scratch/gouge in the middle of a pre-finished 3/4\" maple floor that I installed.\n\nI informed the delivery person of the damage as soon as he put the chair down outside. He came inside, took a picture of the damage and provided me with the route number and the names of his two man crew and indicated that they had insurance and would make it right.\n\nI also took a picture of the damage.\n\nI called Macy's furniture store. I spoke to someone there for a while and they try to get me to connect with somebody at their call center to file the damage claim. I was provided a number to call and an extension, but the sales person did not realize that that number would not work from my phone at the current time and so I wasted 30 minutes trying to navigate the menus and get through to the extension.\n\nAfter wasting time trying to call a number that was not going to work, I finally had time to look at the new chair they delivered. It was not in good shape. The leather was damaged by shipping I think.\n\nI received a voicemail informing me of the 1-888-822-6229 number and that I should talk to Naomi/Niomi. I called the number on Monday and was informed after holding for more time that she did not work on Monday and that I would get a call back. I never got a call back. She managed to call my fiance, but I never got a call. I gave the person my number.\n\nSo finally today, I called to make sure the 3rd chair was going to be delivered and check in on the progress of the damage claim against the floor.\n\nI was told the damage claim had been DENIED. Really? I didn't get a call letting me know. Thanks Macy's Furniture Gallery for sucking at customer service. They claimed that the delivery people claim that the floor was already damaged. Wow.

Here's the text of a letter sent to Macy's CEO on Feb 5h - never got an answer.....\n\nMr. Jeffrey Gennette:\n\nIn August of 2019, we purchased two purses at a Macy's store in Boston.  One purse was $72, the other purse was $27.   At the time of the purchase the clerk rang both purses up as $72.  My wife used Macy's reward credits to offset some of the purchase price, so the $72 charge was adjusted down to $62.  Upon discovery of the clerk's error prior to leaving the store, adjustments were made, and credits were issued.    We left the store with the purses and had paid the correct amounts.  Later in the day, we returned to return the purse we purchased for $62.  More confusion ensued on how to make that return given the reward points and the confusing receipts we had from the earlier transactions.  A manager had to be engaged because the clerk wasn't able to figure out how to return the item and credit back the reward points that were used.  The manager decided to \"void\" the transaction and said that would in effect make it look like we never purchased the purse.  In the end, we had purchased one purse for $27 and left the store with a whole slew of credit charges, return receipts and one \"void\" transaction receipt.\n\nWhen we received our Macy's bill there were a series of charges and credits, however, the net of those showed that we had a charge of $62 still on our bill ostensibly for the purse we had returned.  We called and disputed the charge and that began a series of \"investigations\" which have all ended the same way.  Macy's sees a credit for $62.50 and says that was the return, but that in fact was the original correction to the original purchase where the clerk charged us a net $62 for a $27 purse.  We have tried in earnest to explain to whichever call service / supervisor we speak with, but in the end, the message does not get through.  \n\nWe are tired of calling and asking for a credit.  I actually paid the disputed amount because the last time the \"investigation\" ended, I found out about it ending and failed to call and complain prior to the end of the billing cycle and was charged a $35 late fee plus interest on $62.  I was able to get those charges reversed while the Fourth Investigation started.  We have repeatedly asked to speak to a supervisor or department head to resolve this matter but have never been able to speak with anyone who has the authority to resolve this matter.\n\nThe staff that we have been working with is incapable of understanding this series of events and communicating the correct decision to the ultimate decision maker; which is that the Macy's employees involved in the original purchase and return processed things so poorly that it appears that the purse was not returned.  \n\nWe are not trying to cheat Macy's out of $62.  We have been lifelong customers of Macy's.\n\nIf this latest investigation/inquiry does not result in a favorable ruling for us, we will cancel our Macy's credit card and NEVER buy anything from Macy's again.  I'm watching the news this morning and CNBC reports that Macy's is closing 125 stores and laying off two thousand employees.

So basically it is status quo or they can PARTIALLY build the bed.  TO SUMMARIZE: it has now been over 2 months since our original purchase, delivery people have shown up at our house 3 TIMES and (a) we still do not have a bed to use, (b) we still do not have the hardware we need, and (c) there is no end in sight to all of this.   \n\nI have filed a dispute with my credit card company to stop Macy's from getting paid... which is the first time I've ever had to do that in the decade-plus that I have had a credit card.

He showed me a bigger ottoman and I liked it, so I agreed to order it UNTIL he told me the ottoman was special order and the couches weren't, so my options were: 1)Pay a complete separate (unadjusted- usually you get a higher price on the first item, then discounts on any additional items) delivery fee, or 2) wait 10-14 weeks for my couches. Hmmmm, tempting. Not. I even asked if we could just pick the ottoman up, Nope! So needless to say they didn't sell me any ottoman. \nSo now it's time to order the couches and the computers are down. Lovely. So after 20 minutes of waiting, Peter decides to write my information down on a piece of paper that does not so much as SAY Macy's on it. He spells my name wrong, it's all a very fun experience I assure you. No member of management ever came out to address the situation, just left us all there waiting, and waiting, and waiting.

I should have walked away right there. So I purchased  $60 worth of stuff and ended up returning it because guess what? Online acknowledges the free gift with original price NOT after discount. The sweet lady that helped return the products said her coordinator makes them give the gift if $35 is spent after the discount.  Ridiculous.

Actually, this was the closest to a religious experience that an atheist would ever encounter. This is just my single experience, but I hope it serves to be invaluable to any frugal skeptics out there. Here's my account:\n\nI'm a suit virgin--never worn a suit before, let alone purchased one. I probably looked like one, too, as I walked in to this Macy's in combat boots and a disheveled button down. Initially, no one approached me because they probably saw a broken dollar sign or a maxed out credit card. A fair and correct assessment. However, one salesman, laconic yet patient and accommodating, greeted me and gave me a perfunctory tour of their collection of extra slim suits. As he was pointing out what would best fit my style, I was quietly taking note of what would best fit my budget of $200. Naturally, the salesman showed me \"moderately-priced\" suits ($500-$700), which in comparison, to a miser like me, made climbing Mount Everest more feasible. After visiting the fitting room three or four times and spending more than an hour arguing with my indecisive mind, I finally settled on two separate pieces. I knew the blazer would be no more than $100 after all the discounts (a savings of $195). However, the pants I chose were $150. No discounts. The total was over my budget, but at this point I conceded, only because I was hungry---for alcohol. The salesman rang me up and finally labored to smile. As soon as I walked out, my mind reactivated, and I felt the pang of remorse brewing like a frothy, golden IPA. I began pacing up and down Washington St., cigarette after cigarette, rationalizing, justifying, conciliating, and then acquiescing: \"Just return the damn pants, you milquetoast.\"\n\nThis mantra was on repeat: \"You are the customer, you are the king. They serve YOU.\" I even prepared rebuttals and snide remarks, because I didn't want to enter a battleground unarmed. My salesman was nowhere to be seen, so I exhaled for the first time since reentering the store. But I choked on false security when I saw him pop out of the fitting room. The entire floor became dimmer. He eyed me, censored thought bubbles forming from his cocked head, and motioned to an open register. Even before I could say anything, he asked gently, \"Are you reconsidering the pants?\"\n\n\"I want my money back,\" I said. Because I'm so tactful.\n\nTruthfully, I didn't want to return the pants because they fit beautifully. Unfortunately, they didn't fit my budget beautifully. There was a long pause as he followed the protocol of returning items. Like a break in the clouds, the darkness began to retreat when the salesman asked: \"What if I were to give you a discount?\"\n\n\"Okay. Yeah.\" I was incredulous but still holding onto my eloquence.

Why do I have to leave the store and not take an escalator?  It ruins the whole mall experience!\n\nSo I really do love Macy's but totally despise this one.  I always used to go to Macy's back home because they have such a great selection.  The Cellar is wonderful!  This Macy's has almost no household section.  Their lingerie section never has anything I want.  When I cross the mall to the clothing section, it's totally disorganized, far more than any other Macy's and I can never find any clothing that appeals to me.  The handbag section also has almost nothing.  So why even call yourself a department store?  I'm so ashamed of you, Macy's.\n\nBut you do get a second star for being ultimately so convenient to where I live and also for once in a blue moon, having a hidden gem, like that ever-comfy microfiber throw filled with goose down on sale for $10 down from $60!

I am completely direction-challenged so I avoid going to these big stores because, knowing me, I'll get turned around and lost. Fortunately, the MAC counter was smack dab in the middle of the Macy's store so it was hard to miss. This MAC is much smaller than the MAC Cosmetics store in Perimeter and, based on this and previous experiences, seem to run out of products quite quickly. But, this may be also because I always look for the most sought after items. No worries though, there are three MAC stores in Perimeter and you're bound to find what you're looking for in at least one of them. I came in, stood at the counter for a little bit testing out lipstick shades and waited for an associate. There weren't that many associates working, I believe I saw one cashing out and two helping out customers. There were more customers than associates and it seemed like every customer had a question so I did have to wait a bit for someone to come help. But no worries, I was having fun testing out lipsticks anyway.

This Macy kind of blows. I had initially wandered in trying to find Dansko's, which they unfortunately didn't have. Is it just me or is the shoe section really tiny here? For such a small area, they did  have a rather large selection of stylish looking comfort brands. None of them were quite what I was looking for, though. \n\nThen I went up to the women's apparel floor and into the Plus Size section. It's an ok amount of floor space, but good God! The clothes were all so old and dowdy. The only cute and contemporary looking clothes were the business suits. As much as I'd like to add some more professional items to my repertoire, all I really wanted was a cute dress. I know they carry brands like American Rag, Calvin Klein, MICHAEL by Michael Kors, DKNY and such in other locations...for being a location surrounded by so many other high-fashion and high-end retail, why aren't these brands carried there? It was all Style & Co. and Levi's. Not even INC. International! UGH!\n\nI even went up to the floor with the formal dress and Juniors section hoping they might have some Junior Plus selections mixed in and the sales associate said there wouldn't be much to find. She even admitted the plus size selections available sucked. Um, sucked is putting it mildly. \n\nI really only see myself returning to visit the Brow Bar or the bathroom.

It was opened as Rich's in 1971 and  evidently has not had an exterior renovation since that time.  Someone needs to get to work!  \n\nI learned today that I don't really care for this location because customer service is poor at best.  It's always nice to be welcomed even if you don't need assistance.  The staff, (especially in the cosmetics area), was just too busy hanging out to provide service. No problem because this mall is big enough to meet whatever need you have and you don't have to tolerate poor  customer  service.  We simply left and found the perfect store with impeccable service.\n\nOne of the things I noticed as I was looking over the men's ties, is that their tie selection must have been a part of the original deal to purchase the building because they are very dated and unattractive.  Also, how can you be a real Macy's if you don't carry Ralph Lauren ties?.  Isn't this one of their major brands?  \n\n Okay so here's the real tea....  They are discontinuing the Ryan Seacrest collection because it is not selling.  There is only one word to describe this collection UGLY!!

Pedestal table with a leaf of a certain size.  We happened upon Macy's by accident and, after several days of consideration, decided to buy a table there.\n\nAfter completing lengthy paperwork to buy the table we were THEN told that they didn't have it in stock.  That, in fact, this table basically didn't exist anywhere in America and it would take several months for it to arrive.  Ok, fine, whatever.  We agreed to this.\n\nWhen the table finally arrived nearly 5 months later, it was broken.  The mechanism to close the table with the leaf removed didn't work.  So we had to schedule a new table to be delivered.  This meant I had to plan for another four hour window off of work.  They were late the first time, maybe the second time would be better.  No.  In fact, the second time, they were even later than the first.  When I called to ask when they might be coming, they couldn't even find my appointment in their calendar.  But they came anyway.  That table was broken, too.  When the table was closed without the leaf, there was a gap of over half an inch.  So I had to schedule yet ANOTHER delivery.  Two weeks later, another table arrived.  This time, the leaf was an entirely different color as the rest of the table.  So yes, I had to schedule yet another delivery.  By this time, I've taken over 2 days total off of work to accommodate them delivering tables.  Finally, the final table was correct.  Everything works and the pieces of wood all match.\n\nBut....I've had the table for a little over a month now, and it's a piece of crap.  I can't sneeze near it without it getting scratched.  Seriously, a table setting without a place mat will scratch this table.  \n\nI feel like I just flushed $1100 down the toilet.

I cannot tell you how many dishes of pink peppermint candy ice cream I ate with my Grandma after lunch in the Georgian Room.  I shopped there for years, and my first credit card was issued to me by them when I was 21.  My parents took me to Santaland and to ride the train for years.\n\nOK, now that I've established my pedigree, I'll pry my mouth open and say that I can't blame Macy's for the overall \"droopiness\" of this store.  It's the location and the trend toward shopping in smaller shops/stores.  Towards the end, Meier & Frank was droopy too in this location.  It's sad to see because Nordy's does a great business, but they are far more specialized than Macy's and have a lot more pzazz.  I can't help but wonder what will happen when Target finally opens just a couple of blocks up the street? \n\nEvery once in awhile I've gotten a great deal at Macy's via the use of coupons and sales, but it's not enough to justify my shopping there steadily, plus I can get great deals elsewhere in town or online.  I thought perhaps the droopiness factor would evaporate after the year-long remodel because so many of the floors were used for Hotel Nines and Urban Farmer and Departure were added.  And to give credit, the remodel for those establishments is gorgeous, and I enjoyed a drink at Departure this summer out on their outdoor deck and took in the breathtaking nighttime view.  It's too bad that Macy's can't take a cue from some of that glamour and add it in to the store.    \n\nFor now, I'll remain probably a once-a-year shopper when I find a great deal, unless they provide me with compelling reasons to shop otherwise.", "date": "2012-10-31 13:38:37"}, {"review_id": "6puLqS28mqDzKN4xXpQiKQ", "user_id": "cIXta73AFX6hYFR4m78BFg", "business_id": "6U_QsNNzio5-Dva0u8dqDQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This Macy's is pretty big and they have a huge collection.

Maybe the crate with the decorations never arrived and that's why there were a bunch of bare plastic trees on wheels. Where was Santa's giant magical throne?

They have everything in a dedicated space which is just fantastic. It's not like Nordstroms or Sephora with a small section of a wall of their stuff, this place has EVERYTHING and the people manning the counters know their stuff. Honestly, it kind of feels like a pop-up inside Macy's. Not sure if that's what they are going for, but yeah, really nice.\n\nWhat I feel truly sets this location apart, is that they carry both the full make-up and full skincare line. Very few places carry both ranges in store so that's really awesome for someone like me who really just loves the brand cuz I can try out all the products there before I buy them. They also are fairly generous with the samples, so if you have any concerns about whether or not a product will work for you, then this is another great reason to stop by here.\n\nI also wanted to call out that I received some FANTASTIC and enthusiastic customer service from Stephanie Henderson. She was supposed to head home and stayed late because she saw everyone else was busy and didn't want me to stand around waiting. In-spite of my insisting she just go home and let me wait, she tried a ton of different products on me, set me up with some samples, and then helped me order the tonic they were out of which I really wanted. Seriously, she loves the product, she kept getting excited and saying \"Oh, you know what, this is probably gonna work better on you, let me try this\" Just really fun and gracious. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I get excited about make-up and I like to shop from other people who also get excited about it. She totally did!\n\nOverall, if you want to purchase Bobbi Brown, or just learn more about the product, this is the place to come in the ATL.

The employees of retail stores are quoted the return/exchange and policies and procedures of the store.  If they do not follow them they have been told in advance they can be terminated.  For some people this is their bread and butter.  And to some retailers once the tag is off it means that you have worn it.  And look at it this way.

I immediately ran back to the store and searched for it. The sales associate in the Petite section and the store manager, Jasmine helped me look for the car key in the fitting rooms, counter tops, floor, everywhere.  We all know that when we are panic, our brains are blank. My brain was not working at that time. When the store light was shut down at 10:30 p.m., we still had no luck. I finally gave it up. I left my name and phone number with Jasmine. She said she was going to text all sales associates. Hopefully someone who finds my key would return it to the store register. When Jasmine walked me out of the door, we passed a fitting room which was my 1st stop but I forgot it. See, I told you my brain was not working. This fitting room that I have not yet checked. So I walked in the room which I tried clothes, but it was all cleared. Jasmine then checked the cashier's drawers. Then the miracle happened: my car key was sitting in the drawer! I was so excited! She was my lucky star of the day! When I walked out of the door at 10:40 p.m., Jasmine and the security clerk still stayed late because of me! I was so touched. I am so grateful to have Jasmine on my side when I was hopeless. She is so professional, helpful with great work attitude. Kudos to Jasmine and her team! You are the BEST!

Great people watching guaranteed.

Not sure as to why but the lay of the land is better or maybe the people that work here are better. When I needed Shisedo stuff in the past I would drive out of my way to come to this store. \n\nI've had great experience at the Chanel make up counter here in the past as well with the sales associate helping me find a lipstick that had been discontinued. This sales person actually called me about a week or so later after I visited the place and said that she found a couple of the lipstick shade that I was searching for and would set it aside for me...what great service....\n\n985th review 12/14/2017", "date": "2017-12-14 17:36:22"}]
