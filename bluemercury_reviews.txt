I went in yesterday to pick up a few things. I received no greeting as I entered the shop, and zero acknowledgment as I walked around gathering my products. Not a huge deal, but I wanted an eyeliner, which requires a sales associate's assistance. I stood there a good few minutes, testing a few colors, and there was no attempt to ask if I needed help. They lost part of my sale for that reason. The woman working the cash wrap was eating a very smelly bowl of food. Honestly, with all the nice things to smell in Bluemercury, I found it very jarring and off-brand for store that otherwise purports to provide a luxurious sense experience. The phone rang during my checkout transaction, and my email was never taken. Apparently it's unimportant to customer relations. The phone call also must have distracted the checkout girl beyond her capability to multitask, because, as I discovered this morning when I looked at my slip, I was double charged for one item and not charged at all for another. That's the final straw for me. And I wasn't going to complain about this, but I spent over $150 and got zero samples. I don't want to spend my money here any more.

First, my mom asked a question about a tester of a facial product and she said in the most bored tone, \"oh, all the testers are broken.\"  Broken? All of them? Really? Then, I bought a product that was marked at $42.00 and it rang up at $45.00. I didn't realize it until it already went through. When I noticed, I showed her that it was marked at $42. She couldn't have cared less.  She picked it up, took off the sticker that said $42, scanned the barcode underneath and said, \"nope. It's 45.\"  I said, \"but it's marked at 42.\"  Again she didn't care and she apathetically said, \"I can't change the price.\"  Granted, we are only talking about three bucks, but most stores, if they put the wrong price, they will sell it to you at that price. And really, it would've been fine if she had shown any reaction other than rudely insisting that I was wrong and she couldn't do anything about it.  My mom, who was with me, asked if there was a manager we could talk to - again it's the principle! Her response was a flat, \"no, we don't even have a manager.\"  We went back to the product on the shelf to see if maybe only mine was marked wrong, but they were all marked at 42.  We said, \"you might want to change the sticker on all of these, even though you clearly don't care\" and left.  \nI get that everyone is entitled to a bad day, but come on!

The problem was that she was so sloppy, there was makeup even on my ears! I told her, my earrings can't get makeup on them. She said casually, just clean them at home. Well I took them off once I realized what was happening, but it was too late :( They had powder in them and you can't remove that. There are tiny holes around the diamonds, and once you get junk in there, it is there to stay. I was so disappointed because they no longer make these earrings. That's why I bought 2 pairs. You can tell from my photo how cloudy the pair is now that I wore there compared to the clearer pair with more detail. They still sparkle but less. They were not inexpensive either. In real life the difference is much larger, it's tricky to capture with a camera. It has been so difficult to find earrings that fit everything I want, which these did :(\n\nI wrote an email on October 12 to Blue Mercury customer service and I called the store too. At the store level Kimberly took down an \"incident report,\" but she didn't seem to take it so seriously. She claimed I'd hear back. If you call their corporate customer service, it's just a voicemail, and they don't return calls. They have all my personal info; full name, email, address, phone #, and nothing has happened.I did get an automatic email response that my issue was resolved. Really?!?! That's news to me! How was it handled!? lol. No compensation, not even an apology! I went as far as to email the founder on Nov 9, Marla Malcolm Beck, no response. At this point I was more frustrated about being ignored than anything else. Apparently she is still very directly involved in the company even after selling it to Macy's for 8 figures. Not sure why Macy's couldn't just get those makeup lines themselves, they were in existence way before Blue Mercury  began, and no doubt they would appreciate being in Macy's. \n\nI should mention that she did not make my nose tip appear smaller. On youtube videos they do succeed with even larger tips than mine, I just can't be using a trillion products. You guys know their all toxic anyway right? I try to minimize my use. She did however tell me I had \"a lot of real estate up here\" referring to my forehead she was using a brush to cake many makeup layers on. I then joked, is that another way of saying I have a large forehead, but she didn't say anything lol. \n\nSephora has the same overpriced toxic stuff, if you need it, just go there, at least the service is usually good.

I was pretty excited when I heard about this new shop opening at Bridgeport. \nI went in later at night and it was a bit slow.  Thank goodness, because I don't think one could browse easily with more than a few people inside.   The brands were just what you'd find at Nordstrom or Sephora, but the shopping experience was not nearly as good.   I like to swatch and try things on before I commit to a $30+ lipstick or eyeshadow, but the store isn't really set up for experimentation.   I did swatch a few shades, but couldn't find makeup remover anywhere, nor was I offered any (even when the salesperson saw me struggling to get lipstick off my hand).  \n\nThe salesperson was so stinkin' pushy and wouldn't let me look in peace.   If I say I don't need blush, don't keep harping about how I need to buy a blush to go with my new lipstick.  I was pushed everything from candles to blush to holiday sets to skincare, even though I said I just wanted to browse.  I'm guessing they work on commission, but this was extreme and totally obnoxious.   Also, the person checking out next to me was loaded down with samples and freebies, probably because they spent more than I did (I get that, I know how life works).  But my sales lady was clearly panicked that I was going to want some too and kept worriedly glancing over at her coworker, who was making her customer giddy with all the free stuff.   I felt really awkward and even though I wasn't expecting a goody bag of samples, I do think it was tacky she didn't even offer me one tiny little sample of anything. Especially when there was a giant jar of samples directly behind the counter and I was still spending a decent amount of money on one thing.  \n\nNeedless to say, I left feeling annoyed and wondered why I spent my money there, when I could have racked up some points at Sephora or had a nice consultation at Nordstrom or Blush in NW.  Nothing about the product presentation, variety, or customer service entices me to return.
