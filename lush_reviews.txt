The attendants are always super friendly without being overly sales person like. \n\nYou can often get demonstrations to test a variety of products...(sure, I'll take a facial.)Talking about variety....there are tons of things to choose from - bubble bars, fizz balls, hand lotions and soaps, facials, stuff for feet - body - face - hands - hair.

We had no intentions on buying anything...but then came Andrea.\n\nShe was incredibly helpful explaining many of the products in the store and was clearly passionate about the products. It's always great when the person trying to sell you stuff really knows the products because they use it themselves!  What's even more wonderful is that we got to sample a bunch of products!  Based on our needs, Andrea picked out a number of products for us to try.  She even found something to fit my vague description of my skin \"sensitive..but not that sensitive.\" Jim got a free salt scrub and massage on his hands (boy was I envious) and I tried a few facial masks (the display looks good enough to eat!)\n\nMost things in the store were a little pricy so I ended up buying just a couple items:\n- Mask of Magnaminty - holy smokes it made my pores visibly shrink! \n- Sandstone soap - you tell them how much you want and pay by the pound. I bought two big hunks for $11 (2 for 1 deal)\n- King of Skin - a solid body lotion that makes your skin feel so soft and smooth, great for after shaving!\n- Love Lettuce - exfoliating mask freshly made so it has to be refrigerated and has an expiration date for its use \n\nFor a few of the items we didn't end up buying, we were provided samples to take home!  I will definitely be back to try out some other products...like their bath bombs.

I was out of my body wash and really wanted to check out what Lush had to offer after my client raving about their products she's tried. I went in hoping for the best with a cranky toddler. I picked up a few things that caught my eye and read into the ingredients and was excited to see some of the most amazing and nourishing oils as the main ingredients. I was approached by Bethany and she sat me down not phased by my daughter's attitude. She let me leave my stroller near the counter, sat me down with a bowl of water,  and thoroughly explained the product I was holding along with a few others that went well along with it while letting me feel them on my hand. Needless to say, 3 hair products later, and some great samples.. I was excited to go home and try my new products. Between the awesome aroma and my excitement to go home and work on a hair repair treatment, I forgot all about the body wash I needed originally. I will be returning soon to replenish my Retread conditioner. I also want to get a full size of the Happy Joy Joy samples I received, the Black Exfoliating Scrub, and whatever else Bethany can help me find for my body wash!

You crumble a serving into the tub (\"like a cookie\", she said) and then run the water. You might try agitating the water to increase your bubble-age.

We make them fresh* by hand using little or no preservative or packaging, using only vegetarian ingredients and tell you when they were made.\"\n\nMy friend is a big fan of Lush so when she came to visit, she \"demanded\" that we stop by here. I am sure I had passed by it while shopping in the mall since I typically enter thru Macy's but I never paid it any mind. They have bath and body items, makeup, hair, and perfume items. I was most interested in the bath products. They have quite the variety of scents, very interesting to look thru them all. You can also try out products with the help of staff. The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful. I bought three different items to try out:\n\nBath bomb - \"exploding with essential oils, flower petals and tons of fizzy fun.\"\nBath melt - \"Our solid bath oils deliver an enchanted bathing experience for those times when you truly want to transform your body and mind. Decadent natural butters and loads of gorgeous essential oils melt into the water and then into your skin, creating a supremely softening and scented sanctuary.\"\n\nI got two versions of the bath melt. One was small like a piece of soap. This one is very susceptible to melting. Even though I stored it in my bathroom under the sink, I check on it to find that it was melting away. Ah! So just the warm temperature can do it. The other version was more of a cupcake-shaped block. You can tear this in half to spread the wealth.

It's way over priced, and too many of the products are disappointing.  At $5-$7 for a bath, the bath bombs are not much more entertaining  than throwing an Alka Seltzer in the bath except it smells better and makes the water turn color.

They don't use palm oil in any of their products, which makes them pricey, but way better for you and the world.  \nPalm oil is a by-product of harvesting palm trees and has lead to the deforestation of acres and acres of precious rainforests, is destroying the lungs of our planet, and making many species extinct (Orangutans!).  LUSH used to use Palm Oil in their products (way back when), but their inventors dedicated 3 years to finding a suitable replacement for Palm Oil.  They now use Coconut Oil, which is more expensive, but so worth it.

After working for a retail corporation, it is rare that I would fully endorse the store; Lush fresh handmade cosmetics is the exception. I can't speak for this personal location as I worked elsewhere but I was always treated with respect and loving support from management and fellow employees. I also respect the ethics and environmental/social agendas the company endorses. \nEach time I have been in this location, I've had nothing but a good experience. Every time I've been in, it's been very busy but I'm always able to find an associate to answer any quick questions. The staff is also friendly and usually portray sunny dispositions.\nAside from that  Lush products are among some of my favorites personal care items. I get the most compliments on my complexion when I'm using Lush's skin care line. They have such a wide array of face care products for all types of skin. They also use loads of natural and high quality ingredients in all their products. REMEMBER THIS: you can always ask for a FREE sample for many of their products. They will make the perfect size to test out. This is especially helpful with their skin care line, because finding the perfect regiment for the face can take some finesse and because of the quality of their products the price point is on the high side. I have fairly sensitive combination skin so I use Angels on Bare Skin Facial Cleanser, with the Eau Roma Water Toner, and either the Imperialis or Celestial moisturizer. They all work great at calming my skin, keeping my tone even, balancing my skin, and keeping pesky break outs at bay. \nLush's bath products are so great. Bath bombs, bubble bars, and bath melts are lovely in scent and sight. They are also loaded with essential oils and butters that will make skin happy and smooth. The shower gels are amazing. The Olive Branch is my favorite. It is incredibly moisturizing for the skin. Their handmade soaps are so pretty and you can have them cut to weight and wrapped in paper like some kind of fancy deli/cheese shop. \nAs far as hair products go, R&B is the perfect extra oomph for conditioning the hair in these dry winter months, and a little bit goes a very long way so I maybe need to buy one a year. No Drought is a wonderful dry shampoo and it smells so zesty and clean. I also swear by their henna hair dye, I'm a natural strawberry blonde, but sometimes I like to embrace the strawberry side of my hair more, the Caca Rouge is natural looking and is loaded with stuff that also nearly doubles as a treatment for the hair. Imagine dying your hair and it coming out more hydrated! \nSo if it's not clear, I love Lush. It's the place I've gone to when I need to buy that lovely scented bath bomb that will help pick me up on a less then sun shiny day. \n\nIf you've never been, go in and let them know (if they don't ask you first), I'm sure they would love to pamper you.", "date": "2014-12-07 02:58:07"}, {"review_id": "FXsgRYJ486FLxp4nAhgXgw", "user_id": "A2zl4XWnv2TH3PbfG1DJWw", "business_id": "NsSuyDfcNHv80_QS0XYKfw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Its my favorite place to go for all my bath needs.

The bath bombs, melts, etc that I bought are all fantastic. What I wouldn't purchase again: the jelly soap. It's just not practical. It smells AWESOME (Sweetie Pie, the purple one that smells like candy) but it doesn't lather enough and it's hard to keep track of a gelatinous soap in the wet, slippery shower. I LOVE my Tuca Tuca massage bar (in-store promo: buy two massage bars and get a free tin, $4 value). The other thing I'm not loving is the Let Them Eat Cake lip balm. It's tinted which is okay, I guess but the color is unnatural and makes my lips look flaky. It's almost like a lip stain. So I've decided (even though the smell is heavenly and tempting), I am not allowed to buy their lip balms anymore. And the Honey, I Washed the Kids soap is the best soap I've ever smelled.

Very easy to travel with and I can see it multi tasking in a pinch.\n\nI also got a foot scrub that smells good and seems like it'll get my feet in order. I don't get why I was cursed with such ugly feet, but I will do my best to make em pretty.\n\nI did get a little crazy and get two make up colors gold and silver (they have other names but whatever). The colors are super pigmented and also can be used as lip, eye, eye lash, or mixed into something else.

It is very weird to use and smells funky but my skin was so soft after just a couple uses and is less oily and clearing up over all.

I adore everything in & about Lush. Everything  in here smells so yummy & nourishes my skin & hair in ways that no other brand or product can. I have yet to try a Lush product that I didn't like, & I've tried many.\n\nNow, if this review were for Lush the company it would end here. But sadly, it's not. \n\nNo, this review is for Lush's store, particularly the one at this location. \n\nEvery time I notice one of my beloved products running low, I cringe because it means I'm going to need to set foot inside a Lush store. And stepping inside a Lush store means that I'm going to be subjected to Lush's pushy, nosy, & overly-helpful salespeople.\n\nAs soon as I walk through their doors, I am inundated with three hip, enthusiastic salespeople who vibrantly say hello. I say hi back & make my way over to the shelves I frequent each time I come in. A girl with facial piercings & gelled-up hair approaches me & asks if I'm looking for anything in particular. No, I say, I know exactly what I need. She smiles & tells me that if I need anything or have any questions to let her know. I thank her.\n\nI linger at this shelf a bit before selecting my favorite spray toner. I was running dangerously low & the idea of having this sweet smelling rose water in my possession again made me giddy. My glee is brutally interrupted by the gelled-up hair girl who quietly comes up from behind me & exclaims that that is her FAVORITE TONER EVER. She then asks me if I've ever tried any of their other facial products. I say yes, that I've tried most of their line. She smiles sweetly & says again that if I have any questions to let her know. I thank her.\n\nI move to another shelf, the one where the perfumes are kept. This time, a different salesperson comes up to me & asks me if I knew about their new fragrance line. No, I say, only mildly interested. This one proceeds to tell me unsolicited information about said perfume line as I try to inconspicuously tune him out. He asks what my favorite scents are. Vanilla, I say, which is what I was coming in to buy in the first place. He exclaims with delight that if I like vanilla then I MUST try this one new scent which has hints of vanilla in it. He dabs the inside of my wrist & I take a whiff. It smells good, but it's not what I'm looking for. I tell him that I'm actually interested in Vanillary, which I pick up & put in my basket.\n\nHe looks puzzled that I have made a choice so easily when there are so many amazing things to choose from. He giggles as he makes a joke at my decisiveness, & offers to help me again should I have any questions about anything in the next two minutes. I thank him.\n\nI'm nearly done with my shopping trip when something pink & glittery catches my eye. A new bath bomb, perhaps. I walk over, pick up the bomb, & smell it, getting flecks of fuscia glitter on my nose. It smells divine, like cotton candy covered in rose petals & whipped cream. Then, gelled-up hair girl prances over & asks eagerly if I've ever tried their bombs. Yep, I say a bit briskly, adding that I've been using Lush products for the last seven years. \n\nThe girl's face brightens at my loyalty. She then asks whether or not I have dry skin after bathing. I say that I do & instantly regret it, because now I am being led by the hand to where their body butters are kept. She wants to demo a body butter on my arm that is JUST PERFECT for dry skin. \n\nIn that moment, I want to fall out like a three-year-old & yell at the top of my lungs, \"PLEASE LEAVE ME BEEEE!!!\" because I've now been in the store 30 minutes when the trip should've only taken ten & my arm is sopping wet & I'm really hungry, & OH MY GOD she needs to exfoliate my skin with a sea salt scrub first?!?!!\n\nThis happens nearly every time I walk into Lush. The prodding, the fussing, the nosiness.\n\nI mean, I get it. They're super excited about their products. I know they mean well, I do, but I wish they would back off enough to allow me to the explore their wares in peace without their breath on the back of my neck, for the love of all that is holy!\n\nI love you, Lush, but please leave me beeee!", "date": "2013-04-29 02:56:28"}, {"review_id": "todOkos5xGPMjez4Ee8_bg", "user_id": "8lH88XdzbQKTFg9WQZeuCw", "business_id": "NsSuyDfcNHv80_QS0XYKfw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I have no idea if I am reviewing the standalone Lush or the Macy's lush. It wouldn't really matter because I have bought things from both. \n\nLast year my friend gave me a Cinders bathbomb for Christmas and I was hooked. I saw the prices though and figured I better hold off just a bit..I did make it to July. I took a bunch of friends who have not seen the light here and only one was interested. That was lame..but that one friend outspent me because she loved everything! \n\nI love love love the I Love Juicy shampoo. I don't like to wash my hair too much because it would go wild, but the only thing that sucks about having it is my hair being dyed partially blue right now. This shampoo would totally start stripping it out so fast. :( Oddly too it makes my hair oily really fast despite the fact it's for oily hair. Go figure. I don't use it every time for that reason. \nI think one of the salespeople tried to show me the shampoo called BIG and I was like whoa check out the already big hair, it does not need that! But upon her next suggestion of I Love Juicy, everything was settled.\n\nI love combining bathbombs and bubble bars.  I actually cut one of the blackberry bath bombs in half to use twice because it's pretty big. That combined with a marshmallow scented bubble bar was excellent. I don't see that bubble bar on the website right now, I know it had a rather long name so it was nicknamed MMM. Oh well. Then around Christmas, I got the Bearded Lady bubble bar, with a banana-citrusy scent and paired that with another product I can't find. Whaaaaaaatever. \n\nI was going to end this by saying if you like to buy a ton of stuff, their UK site can be of good value for you...but looks like it was breached by hackers so nevermind.

I was in love with this woman by the time I left and must say that both the girls here were so incredibly helpful that I feel intimately acquainted with this product line already.  They also generously donated a huge stash of sample soaps which I'm ecstatic about because the hotel soap is drying my skin into chapped leather.  I also got a free Therapy Bar for spending over $40.  It's a nifty bar that melts into oil in the palm of your hand.  If I ever give someone a massage I'll feel really cool being able to use it.  \n\nWhile there I got the good/bad news that they have just opened up a Lush retail space (good news) in some Macy's (bad news) in Sacramento so I will be able to replenish my supply whenever I need to.

I even asked one of the staff at the location near the Ed Hardy's why they has 2 locations in the mall, and she told me that the clientele on the other side of the mall, won't come down to this side of the mall to buy the LUSH products (Um I really hope we are not THAT lazy!)  \n\n I love Lush, and this is a pretty long review of their products.  \n\nFirst off I love taking a bath....it's soothing and relaxing. \n\nBath Bombs \nMy favorite bath bomb (yes that's right a bath bomb!) from Lush is the honey bee, followed by Fairy Jasmine and Fizzbanger. Honey lumps is good as well, I don't like fizz in the flower and softy, because they contain flower parts that end up floating in your bath tub, and leaving a bit of soapy scum-mess to clean afterward. SOLUTION to this, is to use a knee high stocking and put the fizz in the flower or softy (The English garden one was the worse with the flower bits, but they discontinued it)  bath bomb in the knee high stocking before putting it into your bath, that is the way I kept from getting all the flowery bits into the tub. \n\nBubble Bars \nI love their french kiss and Karma bubble bars! They even have a men's one called \"the wuss\" that smells, well, pretty manly. \n\nShower Jellies\nThe Whoosh is my favorite, but BE WARNED it's weird to shower with this jelly consistency that breaks off into little jelly bits. \n\nMassage bars\nI love the glitterbug and the shimmy shimmy. I use these before going out dancing, and I always get complimented on my glitter shine! These massage bars will get warmer as you massage. \n\nShaving creams\nThey used to have  a \"shave the planet\" shaving cream that is now discontinued. I've tried their Ambrosia, and it's just not the same....\n\nThe soaps\nI have tried almost all of their bar soaps. The cool thing is you can ask them to cut you a bar soap worth 5 euro, or whatever you want to spend, and they will do their best. \n\nSome of my fav's\n~The godmother  \n~The rock star\n~Honey I washed the kids (best seller)\n~Karma \n~Sandstone (real sand to help exfoliate) \n~Sea vegetable (great for exfoliating has natural salt) \n~Bohemian (Nice lemon scent to wake you up in the am)\n\nSome of my not so fav's\n~Mud flaps, I think I became dirtier when I use it\n~No. 1 Seed Soap - weird and seedy\n~Figs and leaves, I had to clean the shower because there were leave remnants in it (yuck!)\n\ngreat for X-mas gifts\nThey have gift boxes that combine a few great items, starting at $19.99. In jan these gift boxes go on sale and you can use the items for a full year (BONUS)!  \n\nStaff/Location\n~The staff has always been friendly at the location near the Ed Hardy's store. Really friendly willing to give me a product demo, involving everyone in the store when they give a demo, they even told me about signing up online and getting invited to \"LUSH parties\" where you can score free LUSH products!

You might notice I've already reviewed the Lush store located in Seattle. Why would I review this one? Well, because the one in Portland is far superior. Not only because it's much more spacious, but because the staff isn't annoying as hell here. \nThe staff at in the Portland location are amazing. I walked over and picked up a tub of Big shampoo and a lady came up to me, asked if I wanted a sample of the Big conditioner, uh, YES! She got me the sample, handed it to me and off she went without a fuss. Now, if this were the Seattle location they wouldn't do that. They'd be like, 'Oh, you should buy the conditioner to go with it, it is SOOOO amazing. I used it today, feel my hair, omg! You should buy more stuff before you leave! BUY EVERYTHING!' Okay, slight exaggeration, but seriously, it's pretty close.\nAnyway, the Portland one is great. The products are the same, but this one is just amazing. I didn't feel pressured to try something out, every now and then they'd come over and recommend something to me or share their experience about something I was looking at but they didn't stick around and breath down my neck, practically shove things into my basket, and fake-compliment me non-stop to get me to buy things. The Portland one is way better, the staff seem genuinely happy and way more relaxed. \nI grew up in the Portland area and moved to Seattle a couple of years ago, so whenever I come back to visit I'll get my Lush fix here.

Yes, the store smells overwhelming, but I have come to recognize the melange as Eau d'Lush, a sweet, spicy, creamy, foodie explosion.\n\nI used to tell everyone I HATED patchouli, but the Karma fragrance changed my mind completely. I really don't mind smelling like a hippie, if patchouli always smelt like Karma. Holiday at Lush is always an adventure, as that's when they release a whole lot of limited edition items, almost always seasonally appropriate.\n\nHowever, my big breakthrough with Lush finally happened when I tried their skincare items for the first time. I will always forever stock up on Tea Tree Water and their fresh face masks, which is something you cannot purchase via their website. The fresh face masks suggests exactly as the name states, and everyone has a favorite: mine is Cupcake.\n\nBecause Lush does not use preservatives, \"fresh\" is always the buzzword here. That also mean that expiration dates for items do come quicker than their preservative-laden counterparts from a grocery store. Be careful not to stock up on too much for that reason. However, their bath bombs and bubble bars keep for a while, but the scents may fade over time.\n\nThe great thing about a Lush store is that you can try almost everything (they have a little sink and bowl), and can request how much soap you want cut off the block. The employees at FL Mall are so courteous and helpful and eager to show you all that Lush has to offer. This location has parties every once in a while, and it does get a ltitle hectic in there, but I would definitely go and buy items during these parties, as they usually have goodie bags when you make a certain amount in purchases and raffles for free stuff. However, in the last year or so, they have moved their parties on Saturdays to Sundays, which makes it impossible for me to attend. I do wish they bring back Saturday parties in the future.", "date": "2009-10-22 01:47:46"}, {"review_id": "5_-6bt-rNqZhqOqvP3H_rQ", "user_id": "hnaSzqVSFQ-0nXO3GmPueA", "business_id": "MiF7-pfRc9KqMomWXtk6OQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Peoples' experience varies and it depends on how you deal with perky salespeople and strong smelling products you don't even know how to use. I've been to this particular location 3 times (once in Las Vegas). On average I'd give a 4 star rating, but each separate trip requires different ratings.\n\nMy first experience at this location wasn't great. People complain of employees that are too excited and more concerned with your money than what you want. I asked the salesgirl there to introduce me to the brand, but all she did was lead me to the expensive lotions and continued to breathe down my neck as I tried to browse. I don't hold it against her; it's her job. But I really didn't appreciate that. 1-star.\n\nAfter becoming more familiar with LUSH products on my own and in LV, I came back a second time. This was the best experience ever worth 5-stars. I already knew what I wanted but this time the salespeople were more helpful in describing the different products to me. A guy who works here was super friendly and easy to talk to. Sadly I forgot his name but I can remember his face at least. I came back the next day and he still gave me a nice sample of soap even though I didn't buy anything that day.\n\nMy recent trip to LUSH I'd give only 3 1/2 only because of how one salesgirl responded to my sister. My sister knows about LUSH but isn't familiar with all the products. One salesgirl mentioned complementary hand massages to sample the different soaps. My sister (wanting a complementary hand massage) asked a different salesgirl to \"sample the soaps\" but told her they can't cut the soaps. Um...WHAT? Okay, she misunderstood my sister and my sister probably should have reworded her question. But that is total BS saying you can't ask for samples of the soaps! I do it all the time! I would have given this experience a 2-star rating but I saw the guy-whose-name-I-can't-remember and let me use a coupon I forgot to use and adjusted my purchase.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: The aroma of the store will make you do a 180 if you are sensitive to scents. Crowds are annoying in this cramped location. The perky employees can either be a blessing or a curse. It's best to stick around and chat and be friendly with the employees that way when you do ask for samples they'll be more glad to do so.

You will want to walk over to the bath bombs (which are cheap), but she will walk you over to the lotions (expensive)  and force you to sniff things you didn't want to sniff. If you do manage to break away, believe me, she will find you because there is no place to hide.\n\nIt is impossible to shop in this store in a calm, solo manner. The sales ladies here latch on to you, and suddenly you have a new best friend you never wanted ordering you to \"Smell this!!!\" If you express interest in something priced by volume, like soap, she will literally paw through the pile and hand you the biggest and therefore most expensive slab. I had one sales rep do this and didn't give me the chance to object, instead taking it up to the cash register so \"It can wait for you.\"\n\nIt doesn't stop at the register, either.

I have never experienced that in this particular location, and this is the only Lush location I can say that about. I really like this store and all of its employees. They are very friendly and welcoming, but not in any way aggressive. They'll ask if you need help and tell you to let them know if you have any questions, as you would expect, but they won't pester you about products you have no interest in. If you ask about something and they don't have exactly what you're looking for, they'll recommend something similar and tell you about it.\n\nThis is the exact kind of service every Lush store should have.

I went to the one in The Florida Mall in Orlando, FL. I had no intentions of buying anything, but I was intrigued by the colorful array of soaps and products that were displayed through the window, so I decided to check it out. When I first walked in, the scent of the store was very overpowering, but they are a soap shop, so I let myself get used to the scent instead of just walking out. I was approached by the NICEST employee I have ever met in my life. She was awesome! Not only did she have immense knowledge of the products they offered, she also let me try the product I was about to purchase to make sure I would like it (the Buffy body scrub). I fell in love and wanted to check out the other products within the same line that they had. The employee that was helping me had customers that she needed to check out and politely asked if she could help them real quick and come back to me. Not 2 seconds later did another employee step in and help us while the other employee was helping other customers. She also had an outstanding amount of knowledge about the products they offered as well. She even got personal and told us where she used certain products on her body to help with issues she was having. After her sharing of her imperfections, I really felt comfortable sharing my flaws with her so she could further assist my needs for a product that would help. She suggested a sugar scrub and told me how she applies it on her body. She then went further to explain that after using the sugar scrub, she used another product that Lush sells called, Lovely Jubblies. I was not satisfied with the price of the product, so I decided to just purchase the sugar scrub instead since it was lower in price and since it was my first time trying lush products. At checkout, both ladies who had helped me in the store knew that I wasn't purchasing the Lovely Jubblies because of the price, so they offered a free sample of the product so I could see if I would like it to possibly return to the store to make a purchase of the product. I was very shocked that they would give me a free sample because most cosmetic stores don't offer that option. The lovely ladies also gave me a free catalog with my purchase of the sugar scrub. This was honestly one of the BEST experiences I have ever had at The Florida Mall. I was not pressured to purchase anything, and I felt super comfortable with the ladies working there.

This review is not about the product but about the store.\n\nI was at the store today, and I have never felt more embarrassed for Lush or its employees before.  First of all, the sales associate who was helping me knew absolutely nothing about the products he was trying to sell me.  Although I am a frequent Lush shopper who has an immense amount of product knowledge and has researched Lush ingredients extensively, I still do not think I should ever walk into a Lush store and be far more knowledgable about Lush products than any given Lush sales associate.  Anytime I asked this associate what a certain product did and why, he gave me vague answers or simply said, \"I don't know; I haven't tried that product yet.\"  Finally at one point, I took the product, read the ingredients, and informed him that if a product has rose oil and aloe, it is most likely for sensitive skin.  I find it appalling and embarrassing that I had to inform a Lush employee of such basic and obvious product knowledge.  I asked for a hair mask with protein, and he did not make the connection that free range eggs have protein.  \n\nHe was not the only employee who was grossly uneducated and under-informed about Lush products and the values of the company in general.  When my mom asked the girl ringing us up if she could recycle her plastic water bottle, the girl behind the counter was not quite sure if the store even had recycling.  Given the fact that Lush not only uses recycled containers but also offers a recycling program (5 black pots for a free face mask), there is absolutely no excuse for a Lush employee not knowing if the company recycles simple plastic containers.  I understand that Florida is full of uneducated shoppers, but that does not excuse Lush employees from not knowing anything about their products or the company for which they work.  \n\nI have never walked out of a Lush store so embarrassed for the store, the employees, and the company.

They knew their products inside and out, what went with what type of skin, and were smiley and helpful without pushing it the whole time. \n\n I was looking for something to polish & scrub my skin after 10 days in the steamy Mexican sun. I didn't want something super harsh, but wanted it to feel like it was actually doing something. Enter Lush's Ocean Salt scrub...I can use it as often as I like and the salty, grapefruity, tingly feeling it leaves lets me know its doing its job. Ditto for the Sacred Truth mask I bought as well. I rarely buy many of the soap & bath bubble products as the scents tend to overwhelm but their fizzy bath bombs are truly 'da bomb...its like taking a bath in champagne! My favorite lush product?  Hands down the Pied de Pepper foot cream...the cinnamon, clove, and vanilla leave my tootsies smelling delicious & tingly perfectly.\n\nwhat can I say? I'm a Lush!", "date": "2008-08-25 14:22:35"}, {"review_id": "R0kd06kz4BdiDuUYNSaijg", "user_id": "HeKBcxLgGEcaGfT98VePJA", "business_id": "bYVgIoLWn0Ya8-K4ERoI4Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Lush is totally awesome.

Thankfully, the soaps are sold by the pound, so you can be as cheap or as extravagant as you wanna be while indulging yourself.

Theyre all pretty much the same in my experience.  So this isnt super relevant to the Harvard location, which was fine and gets 4 out 5 stars.\n\nConfession: Im a lemming for trendy products. Im easily swayed by promises by \"green\"businesses. Im vegan. Im also an introvert. All of these things are strangely relevant to this and any Lush review. \n\n(Introverts Beware) Remember the first time you walked into Yankee Candle? Or Bath and Body Works? Remember the olfactory overload as your nostrils flared and your eyes slighty watered? This will happen to you at Lush. Lush is very overwhelming - everything is pretty, colorful, orderly, smells very strongly, and the sales people are clearly browbeaten into becoming retail Stepford Wives. I feel for anyone who works here, Im sure their employee manual is some kind of draconian Ned Flanders guidebook on helpfulness and closing sales.,, and during lunch breaks theyre beaten with daily sales quotas. It isnt their fault, a few reviews seem to attack them: go to other Lush stores, they ALL behave like that which is a touch terrifying. I dont blame them though, not their fault. It just is a bit taxing to endure and also witness, if youre an introvert you may leave this store exhausted. So go in with ideas of the products first. Bonus is it is one of the few chain retail stores youll see sales associates with body mods though which is cool?\n\n(Trendy Spendy) OK, this place is expensive, and the products dont last super long.  And the effectiveness of certain products at keeping the funk at bay is questionable. However, the packaging and smells are heavenly. And many of the products are fairly easy to replicate if you get too addicted to them, so it is a great place to go to get some ideas if youre into DIY at all. They have cool things like lotion bars that literally melt when you touch them (youll need the tin container, sold separately, so it doesnt dissipate), but dont expect them to last long - youre more paying for the novelty and luxury of it. There are certain products you may get addicted to and end up repeatedly buying anyway as they do try to use effective essential oils and ingredients. If youre on a budget and are a lemming for trends, esp \"eco-green\" ones, dont go here. Youll find yourself rationalizing a monthly $30 purchase for tub of sea salt doused in essential oils (which was me for 6months, no lie).\n\n(Vegan? Natural? Mostly) Im a vegan so we tend to be extremely picky about what \"cruelty-free\" and vegan actually means. Lush's branding is premised pretty heavily on being all natural, anti-animal cruelty, green, and usually people tend to hastily throw \"vegan\" into that whole long list of granola-lovin. About 80% of their products are actually vegan, which is great and a very high percentage and the vast majority!  What major uberpopular company does that? However, that also means that means 20% of products contain animal-sourced ingredients... which to most lifestyle vegans animal-sourced is the antithesis of \"cruelty-free\".  They put a \"V\" on products which is awesomely helpful too and on their site \"Vegan\" is a dropdown category and they spell out each ingredient, so they make it really easy and helpful. However they do have some products that contain \"Lactic Acid\" that are labelled vegan (Rub Rub Rub is one)... they say it is naturally sourced lactic acid, but dont go into further detail on their site except a picture of a bowl? lol. Most cosmetic lactic acid is derived from cow's milk, so......worse I got a vague answer from corporate about lactic acid.  So.... yea. Read their labels for the usual suspects. If youre not that focused on vegan granularity just be aware that you may have to politely dodge the sales person from lotioning you up with a product that you cant/wont use. For the \"natural crowd\" be aware they do use artifical dyes and sodium laureth sulfates, so it isnt 100% natural but is certainly wayyy more natural than what you can buy at most places. I will say that they do have a recycling program which is awesome. OK my rambling  point is for a mainstream company it is pretty eco-forward, but if youre a strict lifestyle vegan  or someone who avoids artificial dyes, definitely read the ingredients\n\nReview: Be nice to the sales associates, theyre just doing their job. The pricing is because it is cute, trendy, and novel - if you need products that arent so scented and will last long go elsewhere. The shopping experience is overwhelming - go in with a plan. It is branded as super-green and eco-friendly, but it is more like expensive hippie stuff made more palatable for yuppies. Im a combo of both the grousing hippie and consumeristic yuppy so I enjoy their products, but... dont believe the hype.

Lush has a VERY bad habit of discontinuing mainstay products to the horror of many of its rabid followers. They do offer (online and on the UK site, natch) a place where you can order discontinued items (if enough people place an order for it, they'll mix a batch). This has saved me from suicide since they discontinued my Banana Moon soap and I thought I'd educate the masses that are lamenting the loss of one of their Lush favorites. So ROCK ON Lush Boston.

The store is clean and tidy, but if you have allergies, the overwhelming smell might bother you. It's similar to a candle store. The sales staff are friendly and helpful, will help you sample products to see how they work (which is a great boon when most of their products are only found there and you'd have no idea what they're for), and the store often has some sort of promotion going on. Most of the time I've shopped there, the staff has given me a free sample of a new product I wasn't ready to buy, which is awesome.

Also good is the Coalface face cleanser (excellent for my winter skin) and their soaps (Alkmaar and Rock Star are my favorites). I haven't found the shampoo or conditioner I've tried (Trichomania and Jungle) to be effective on my chlorinated hair, and the styling product I've tried was also ineffective. That isn't to say that none of their hair products are good, I just haven't found one that works for me. \nLong story short, this place is great if you're into handmade, natural, products, and if you're Ok with parting with a pretty penny to get them.

I'm never really blown away by hair products (my hair very wavy and alternates between dry/oily).... but this blew me away. I've never seen my hair so shiny, and it lasts for days without getting oily.  I imagine you shouldn't use this more than every other day anyways, because it might dry you out.  \n2) Tea Tree toner: Very refreshing and works AMAZINGLY well. I've always had skin issues... combination skin with break-outs and redness.  This is REALLY calmed my face down.\n3) Catastrophic Cosmetic face mask: This is the blueberry face mask. It's the best face mask I've ever experienced, and I've experienced a LOT over the years, trying to calm my skin. It smells great, and it's actually full of blueberrys (that funnily fall off as it dries). It has helped my skin so much -- less red, fewer breakouts, feels great.  When you take it off, there's a slight powder left over, but that comes off with moisturizer or toner.\n\nThe great thing is that you can ask for samples!

Embarrassed to have any human interaction at all since I had a red face, puffy eyes, and tears streaming down my face, I decided to go in any way to seek some relief. I was immediately greeted by Jenn and as soon as I told her I needed to stress relief, she got right to work! Impressed with her friendly disposition, knowledge of all the products and overall professionalism, she made me feel welcome and in the right place. I apologized for my current physical state (crying) and she very politely looked at me and ensured me I was in a \"judge free zone.\" She proceeded to try on several different products on me ranging from body oils to fragrances to makeup, all of which made me feel 100x better. After testing on samples, my curiosity sparked and I decided to walk around the store to see what else they had. Jenn encouraged me to browse and ask any questions I had regarding any of the products. As someone who had worked retail their entire high school and college careers, and has been a manager, I knew Jenn was an employee that went above and beyond for her customers and that is exactly what every employer seeks.\u00a0\n\nHowever, my experience did not end there. I was soon approached by another employee, Alexa (I believe this was her name, but if it is not she has bright blue hair for reference.) Alexa's personality and cheerful disposition caught my attention immediately. She informed me that she was made aware of my situation (since I had explained why I was crying) and proceeded to hand me over a \"goodie bag\" filled with a bunch of samples that I had fallen in love with when testing them out with Jenn. Alexa made me feel confident, relaxed and had very encouraging words of advice. I was able to enjoy browsing all the products and have all my questions answered. After speaking with her, I legitimately forgot I had a bad morning. She too is someone that any employer would be grateful to have.\u00a0\n\nBoth Jenn and Alexa went above and beyond to make my customer experience phenomenal. As a result, I learned of some products that I believe my sister and grandmother would love so I am returning this week to make an estimated $265 purchase for their upcoming birthdays, which I would have never known about if it weren't these two ladies. Being a previous retail employee and manager, I know exceptional work ethic when I see it.

However this tiny store quickly gets overcrowded - not only is it almost impossible to move around and have space to look at products, there just aren't enough staff to help if you have a question or need advice. Forget it on weekends and afternoons - it's not worth the hassle! If you're curious and know you want to ask staff a particular question, be sure to visit as close to the 10am opening time as you can. My other negative point is that specific products or sizes aren't always available, which is a little disappointing if you were after something specific! Sometimes it's just worth ordering online, even though shipping does cost extra. \n\nAn extra tip for Lush lovers like myself - this store now has quite a few products that were previously exclusive to the flagship Oxford Street, London store, so if you're after something special you have to check it out! If they're just too busy or don't have what you were looking for, make a trip to the Florida Mall location which is a little more spacious.", "date": "2016-03-29 20:29:50"}, {"review_id": "UMP60t2UL2Rp2Io1IdUG8A", "user_id": "pVkGrQ1q_hc0aZy-pJcGaQ", "business_id": "bYVgIoLWn0Ya8-K4ERoI4Q", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "it may be a bit rude but i always go in with my head phones on or while on my phone!  they leave you alone since your preoccupied and i can browse in peace...lol i do it all the time", "date": "2012-01-26 13:00:33"}, {"review_id": "gSV5qLMmaZppgY3c7uDDmg", "user_id": "GoXGIueaEON3OTdC-zSaqQ", "business_id": "2vAcs0gWr8xiRGfIwp0qAA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 2, "text": "Dana was super helpful!

That's not what we're here to write about - because frankly, the products are going to be more or less the same whether you're shopping in Harvard Square, Newbury Street, London, or online.  For the record, though, I do tend to like the products Lush markets - they're extremely high-quality, the fragrances are divine, and I love the fact that packaging is kept to a bare minimum.  The prices can be admittedly outrageous, but as long as you think of Lush products as treats rather than staples, you can refrain from spending a small fortune.\n\nSo the products themselves get four stars out of five.  This particular location, however, gets two, maybe two and a half.  The second you walk in, you're accosted by two things: ten billion different fragrances and overly eager salespeople.  Don't get me wrong, there are times when I want that kind of enthusiasm and welcome help, but then there are the times when I just want to be left alone.  When I meet a long-winded description of the brand-new vanilla line that's just in from England with a \"Thanks\" and then continue browsing the bath bombs, I generally assume that that's enough to give the hint that I'd like to shop in peace.  \n\nLush employees don't seem to understand that, as two minutes later they'll be back to offer me a shopping basket or ask if I want to see how the bubble bars work.  I sort of wish they'd let me come to them, because being bombarded with their \"help\" when I don't want it makes me want to rush through my visits to the store rather than linger.  And if I lingered, I might drop more cash, too!  What's weird is that I think Lush trains their employees to use this hovering, high-pressure approach, as I've also shopped at the Newbury Street and Providence Place Mall locations and have had similar experiences.\n\nOverall, I give Lush three stars, and that's mostly for the fabulous products.  If it weren't for the fact that I can't sample the scents, I'd probably switch over to shopping through the website, as the heavy-handed sales approach isn't really my cup of tea.", "date": "2009-05-08 18:12:35"}, {"review_id": "MkO8n57UU_qIEJy4i1Vo-Q", "user_id": "ngpEft7_-WoKkAZ66AO2yA", "business_id": "bYVgIoLWn0Ya8-K4ERoI4Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "By far, the best Lush I've ever visited is at Harvard Square.

So I walk in, I'm greeted, and I head straight for the bath bombs (so clearly I know what I want and what I'm looking for). Then the same woman who greeted me followed me over to where I already knew what I was doing and asked me if I'd ever used a bath bomb before.

She apologized and was clearly offended, so I tried to recover the situation by explaining how much I hate that particular company policy, but I'd already upset this poor girl so much that she had to go off in the back. Then I get up to the front counter and was so flustered by how overly helpful the employee who was ringing up my items was that I somehow told him I don't use soap because I was trying to get out of him selling me things I didn't want because I honestly do not like Lush products. I don't use soap? Really? I made an absolute fool of myself simply because these employees are trained to push their products and their brand as hard as they can.

I've been in LUSH before in my hometown, but not often because their high prices. I saw one of my co workers using a solid bath bar and asked her where she got it. LUSH has been on my mind since then. I walked in with the intention of buying a solid shampoo bar. \n\nA young man was extremely helpful. I asked a lot of different questions like how to use it, how long it lasts, what will it do for my hair etc. He was super patient, really excited to answer my questions and didn't rush me while I smelled each shampoo bar atleast 3 times (if i'm going to be buying shampoo that costs over $10, I need to be thorough with it. Right?) I ended up getting the Seanik and the Jumping Juniper shampoo bars. So far I've only used the Seanik and it's worked really well. My hair gets super oily and since using this, there's significantly less oil in my hair by the time I get around to washing my hair again. Also, it's a subtle smell, but smells great. \n\nI wandered over to the soap bars interested in all the bright colors. I've only ever purchased lust scent (Which has an amazing jasmine scent). I sniffed like all of them feeling pretty bad about myself because I couldn't make up my mind. Again one of the workers came over to help me. I told them I wanted something citrus like and maybe calming. He gave me the Snow Globe and the Angels Delight and I absolutely fell in love with both of them. I didn't know if I wanted to shell out like another $15 to buy both of them, so I asked him if I could buy a small chunk of each one. He ended up just giving me a sample of both of them. I didn't know they were given to me as samples until after I checked the receipt on the way home and wasn't charged for them. So apparently they do give out samples. I'm sure if I asked he would have given them to me. :] \n\nThe Snow Globe sample lasted me a good 5 uses. Smells really nice and citrus-like too.

The sales associate then questioned her type of skin, told her she shouldn't use that face mask, told her she was wrong for using it and then turned his attention to me. She never got her sample.  He then aggressively questioned my type of skin, what I was shopping for and then all of a sudden I was holding 5 pots of product. Don't get me wrong, he was very nice but just wouldn't accept we already knew what we wanted and basically ignored our requests. Once I finally escaped him, I walked literally two steps before ANOTHER sales associate came up to me, asked what I needed and then without letting me answer started putting things into my hands.

That was a few years ago before they started cropping up all over the place in the US. It's a really fun place to check out, but unfortunately, the products kind of suck. Well, everything sucks except for their bath bombs. However, since I can't take a bath in my current bathtub (way too small), I think that I'm ready to write this place off completely.\n\nI say this because my last two purchases were complete trash. Firstly, I needed a new exfoliant for my face. So, being the type who prefers natural products, I decided to throw some loot at one of their exfoliants. I figured that even though it was almost $20 for a tiny container of sea salt scrub, it would be better for my face than all those chemicals you find in mainstream scrubs. Not only that, the salesgirl who kept hanging all over me since the second I entered the store, PROMISED that the container would last at least six months. I am naive. I like to trust. I bought it.\n\nSo, I get it home and open the jar. It was a cool fake aqua color which was cute. You kind of have to mix it around because the salt sits on top. The salt crystals looked mighty large, but the salesgirl PROMISED that it would be extra gentle after I told her that my skin was really sensitive. I am naive. I like to trust. I put it on my face.\n\nAAAGGGHHH! It was like rubbing shards of glass into my cheeks. I figured that I had to break up the salt a bit, so I put a little water in my hands and rubbed them around. That made the crystals smaller, but when I put it on my face, it just dissolved. So, essentially I was just putting salt water on my face, which of course, didn't do anything but sting my skin like a mo' fo. Nice scrub. I still have it, but it is just sitting there in my shower because I can't bring myself to throw away a $20 full container of anything. Maybe if I let it sit there long enough, the entire thing will just dissolve away on its own.\n\nFast forward a few weeks later. I still wanted to believe in this place, so I ended up going back to try some of their soap. Once again, the salesgirl stalked me throughout the store (although she was a different one this time.) \"Look at this, can you believe this?! FEEL my arm. Isn't that amazing? You MUST try the new line of blah blah blah.\" She squealed as she followed me from table to table. After completely ignoring her, she finally got the hint and left me alone - only to come right back as soon as my hand touched a piece of soap. \"Oh my GAWD. THAT soap is the best. I LOVE that soap. SMELL IT!\" Like an idiot, I did what I was told. It actually did smell really damn good, like honeycomb. So, ignoring the $10 price tag for the miniscule bar, I got the ol' wallet out and took my purchase home.\n\nImmediately upon using the soap, it melted to like half its size. Seriously. Five bucks went right down the drain within two minutes. It smelled really nice, but when I tried to actually wash with it, it left this film of..I don't know...butter...butter on my skin. No matter how hard I tried to wash the butter off, it wouldn't budge. Now, my skin is really sensitive and it will break out if oily crap just sits on top of it (like most skin, I suppose.) So in the end, I ended up having to rewash with my cheap bottle of St. Ives in order to get the film off of me. By this time, the soap had diminished to about 3/4 of its original size. \n\nIf you are still with me on this, I will give some praise to their bath bombs. They are fun, smell great, and soften your skin really well. You have to be cool with getting a clogged drain every time you bathe though, because when the bath bomb dissolves, all this junk comes out of it. Its kind of neat and kind of annoying. For example, I once bought their ocean bath bomb which dissolved into a big mess of seaweed and prickly things (have no idea what they were.) In a 'nymph of the sea' way, it was kind of nice to be floating in all this seaweed (just like being in the ocean!) - but the prickly things dug into my legs and other areas really badly. Not to mention the clogged drain that stopped up the tub for two days afterwards.\n\nIf I were you, I'd stick to the bath bombs that have drain friendly things in them, like glitter or dissolving petals.

I was instantly overwhelmed when I entered LUSH, but fortunately (?) a charming young sales chica came right up to me to point out each and every product and make gift suggestions. She also informed me of the current promotion of spend 40 smacks and get a free shower bomb, spend 50 smacks and get the bomb and a goodie bag. Gooooooooodie!  She was friendly and sweet. I appreciated the help. She even scrubbed my hands with a lovely exfoliating Buffy body butter.

The product packaging is minimal for the lovely fresh ingredients that go into the items. They do have premade gift boxes with fun names like the Good Karma gift set and Butterfly kiss gift set. They also have a gift wrapping service ($) if you want to make up your own gifts. After what felt like three hours of  absorbing all the lush scents into my brain,  I decided to go with the \"It's a Wrap\" gift set, which is an organic cotton travel case for lush goodies that had three tins in it for me to fill with products for m'lady.  I chose the Buffy body butter (obvi), the Each Peach massage bar, and the Karma Komba solid shampoo!  It looks like candy!!!!  A succesful birfday gift, I do believe.\n\nI made the quota for the free stuff and the goodie bag was filled with samples of various items like shower gel, a bath bomb, and butter cream. yayay.\n\nI love that the products are natural and some are vegan.

The shampoo lasts a lifetime (in shampoo years) and has yet to go bad on me because it takes so little to get a good lather.

They also do a very good job being at the forefront of the latest health trends, as well as environmental trends, meaning they already have the next essential ingredient for staying healthy and young, and will be the first to tell you why exactly you need it. \n\nSo what I'm saying is, Lush is great if you want to go occasionally to treat yourself.

I have been to this store a million times (despite the fact that I have never, ever bought anything for myself), and still, every time I go I get three different people offering me that hand treatment, people asking me if I know about the sale that's going on, people asking me who I'm shopping for, what kinds of products I need and what I've tried before.

Knowing that certain smells and especially perfumes trigger migraines for me, he was very careful in mentioning this to the salesperson.  Basically, lavender, rosemary, and lemon verbena are the only scents that don't bother me, make me sneeze, or trigger migraines.  I have soaps and natural oils in these scents and love them.  The salesperson assured him that Lush products were \"totally organic and natural\".  She put together a lovely wrapped package of various bath products in lavender scent.  It was beautifully packaged and such a thoughtful gift.  Unfortunately, I would consider the claim of \"all natural\" to be false.  The ingredients include fake food dyes (completely unacceptable in products that are supposed to be \"all natural\") and sodium laureth sulfate- a completely unnecessary chemical that I try avoid in all of my and my children's products.  I wanted to like this, but the real test was in the scent.  The lavender in my garden smells so good.  This \"lavender\" made me sneeze, my nose run, and triggered a migraine.  I can smell it from 2 rooms away- and it smells nothing like real lavender.  I cannot even imagine trying to relax in a tub w/ that smell.

But the customer/employee dynamic is so incredibly wrong.\n\nThe customer interactions are NOTHING like what I've come to expect from Lush. I'm a hardcore Lushie, I know all the products and the smells and every bath/shower/skincare/hygiene product I own is Lush. So usually, when i go in to a Lush and they ask me if I want help then I can tell them \"No thanks, I know my stuff.\" and they will back off immediately and let me know they can help if I need anything. \n\nBut these people will not leave me alone at all. I practically have stare them down and tell them to go away to make them stop trying to shove a ton of products in my face. I literally cannot say a word, even \"hello\", to an employee here without them trying really hard to make me buy 10x the stuff went in to buy. Part of why I like Lush is because I know what I want and what I need so it's easy to run in and grab it, but I can usually also browse and see if I want to treat myself, and I can usually chat with Lush employees when the shop is empty and we can just have a regular conversation.\n\nThese employees are like freaking car salesmen. They are 100% focused on selling as much as they possibly can and I hate it. They aren't personable or genuine at all. Every bit of friendly talk comes across like them trying to buddy up just so they can load you up with $200 worth of products (which, in all honesty, I buy on my own sometimes, but I don't want to give my money to this store if they're practically clawing it out of my wallet).\n\nIt's incredibly annoying that I can't go in to browse a little on my own for anything extra I want without being pounced. When I visit I have to make a bee-line right for what I need a refill on, grab it, and go straight to the register.

Sure it smelled pretty good but looked like something you would find in an Indian toilet and they were happy BEFORE using the products.\n\nFirst off, there's one that youre supposed to use to make your bum super soft.  It's some kind of buttery oil bar but it winds up making your bum look like the moon.  You get like bonkers acne and tons of craters.  Not smooth.  I know, I felt my roommates bum and it wasn't cool anymore.  Then there was this \"flying fox\" thing that was supposed to be for women who are having their period to use to \"chill out\".  You don't even stick it anywhere or whatever, you just use the soap and the \"fragrance\" cools you out.  Wrong again.\n\nThis is all over priced hype product.

It makes your skin feel fabulous!\n\nThey have great fresh face mask options too. I've tried the Mask of Magnaminty and Love Lettuce. Really liked both. Wasn't a big fan of a coal face wash that I used. It felt great as a scrub but my skin didn't react well to it - I'd have mini breakouts every time I used it which was very unusual for me. I gave it to someone else who ended up loving it. I love how the products make your skin feel overall.  Will definitely be coming back again and again to try different shower bombs, body bars and face masks.   \n\nCheck this place out if you're looking for a nice at home spa day!", "date": "2014-07-21 15:22:05"}, {"review_id": "POYbvnRwSu3J7XecGiokhw", "user_id": "84Tx5eFRCC1uYzRXKgAq0g", "business_id": "ZpMTJxXE1NLgxjKIIIlGFQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "LUSH is my guiltiest pleasure.

I've been using their products long before they opened a shop in the United States. I used to have to order their products by mail, sight unseen, from Canada. So I was thrilled when the Boston shop opened in 2003, because I had just moved there. While I appreciate being able to finally try products before I buy them, there are two things about Lush that I don't appreciate: 1) pushy sales people, and 2) ever-increasing prices.\n\nIt seems to be a common feature of all the Lush stores I've been in to train their sales associates to be really aggressive. As soon as I walk in they ask if I've been to Lush before. Yes, I reply, many times. But it doesn't end there. If I walk over to the bath bombs, they follow me and initiate a conversation about the bath bombs. If I walk over to the hair care products, the same associate will follow me and initiate a conversation about the hair care products.One woman asked me so many questions I felt like I was getting the third degree. Sometimes I just want to browse by myself and not talk to anybody. Despite the shop's funky vibe, it's as bad as a department store's cosmetics department.\n\nThe second issue I have with Lush is that they keep raising their prices every year. When I was ordering Lush by mail, they were really reasonable. Moisturizers cost between $6 and $10. Canadian exchange rate aside, Lush products were just more affordable than they are now that they're so popular. I see the prices of moisturizers rise by at least a dollar every year. That reasonable $8 jar of Celestial is now $23.\n\nBottom line: I love their products, but their employees need to tone it down a bit, and some of their products are becoming too expensive for me to use regularly. And have you ever noticed they don't seem to employ anybody over the age of 35? People in their 40s and 50s and older can be funky, attractive, Lush-loving fans, and their older customers might not feel so intimidated walking into a Lush shop. Being a big Lush fan, I have applied for several positions, been told I'd get a response soon either way, and never heard back from them.

Get the Ocean Salt for this purpose. \n\nMange Too: Smells so good, very moisturizing, I use it like a body lotion. \n\nWiccy Magic Muscles: Looks cool, smells great, feels great, those little beans get aggravating as soon as they start popping out. \n\nChristmas Massage: Delightful, fresh, uplifting scent that you could use the whole winter.

As soon as I stepped into the store, an apron-clad sales associate pounced on me.  \"Can I help you,\" she asked in an overly-chipper voice that should be reserved for someone on helium.  In an attempt to satisfy her and make her feel needed, I asked her about a soap that I haven't seen in a while--turns out it was discontinued.  \n\nI thanked her and told her I would be browsing and *would* be sniffing the soaps.  She stepped back a bit.  I continued to browse near a table filled with soaps.  I selected two and held onto them, continuing to browse at another display.\n\nLike a missile, the sales associate shot over to me at full speed.  \"Do you want a basket\", she chirped in that high-pitched voice that only animals should be allowed to hear.  I sighed and took it from her, putting my soaps in it.  As I made my way to the back of the store, she came over once again when I started to look at their shampoo bars that come in little tins.  \"Do you need any help,\" she inquired again--this was 20 seconds after she handed me the basket.  \"No,\" I stately flatly.  I was getting really tired of the hovering.  It messed with my head as I attempted to make my selections.\n\nI nabbed a box of shower jelly and headed to the cash register.  It was manned by another gal.  She oohed and aahed over my selections--I swear, they're trained to do that.  I mentioned that I enjoy the more classic products.  \"Oh, then have you tried our Dream Cream,\" she said in a voice that was almost as high-pitched as the first sales associate that stalked me.  With that, she ran over to a display and brought it back.  I took a whiff and wasn't impressed--I told her I wasn't interested.\n\n\"Oh, do you like fruity fragrances better?  Here!  Here--let me get you another one to try.\"  She bolted back over to the display, leaving me wondering when I would be able to make my purchase and leave.  She was definitely coming on a little too strong.  She came back with the next sample for me to sniff.  \"Doesn't it smell like french vanilla,\" she asked, sounding waaaay too excited about hand cream.  I shook my head and said I wasn't interested.\n\nAs far as Lush products go, I absolutely love them.

Truthfully, I'm a Lush whore.\n\nI first stepped into Lush in San Francisco about 5-6 years ago, and while I thought it was a great concept, I had to leave immediately.  I'm extremely sensitive to smell and this place seemed worse than a Yankee Candle.\n\nHowever, recently I've become obsessed.  On one trip, I picked up a couple bath bombs - butterball, which is awesome, and Youki-Hi, which was ok but I wasn't crazy about the pink water or the glitter that landed on my skin afterwards.  I went in to get stuff for my hands and feet, which are eternally dry.  I got suckered, ahh convinced into buying Lemony Flutter for my feet, Ocean Salt scrub - which, while is great for the body, not so much for my apparently sensitive face (who knew?), consider yourself forewarned, and Dream Cream (LOVE this stuff).  Turns out, I wanted to spend nearly my entire paycheck that week at this place and that wasn't enough.  I also picked up Big shampoo - quite possibly the coolest shit ever, and Veganese conditioner.  Finally I stood up for myself and said no thank you to the bigger bottle, the small one is just fine for now thank you very much.  That showed them!  But then my arm got twisted into also getting the Amazonian massage bar.  Smells like sexy heaven and not only serves as a solid massage oil, but also is a super moisturizer if you want to use it for other ways.\n\nNext trip, I picked up more bath bombs - more butterball, Honey Bee and Lush Pod.  Haven't tried either of the new ones yet, but I can't wait.  I was scoping out stocking stuffer ideas for myself and once again couldn't help but be pushed, oops tempted to get some other stuff on the spot.  I bought a hunk of Alkmaar soap and a mammoth glacier-sized chuck of Snowflake soap.  God I love that stuff!  I nearly bought an entire sheet of it, but for $90 (or was it $130?), I figured that was juuuuuust a bit much for frickin soap.  I needed a tin to hold said soap, and my arm was twisted into getting a couple massage bars so the tin was free.  I've heard so much about Buffy the Backside Slayer and tried it out - holy exfoliation.  And then I picked up Running to the Embassy, which is not nearly as wonderful as the girl in the store claimed it to be.  Big surprise.\n\nI do think the salespeople are slightly out of control, but I agree with the poster that said it's worse on the weekends.  Go during the week in the evening, the staff is much better then.  Especially now that it's holiday time.  I've found on the weekends, multiple people surround customers like hawks, but during the week, it's almost like one person tries to take care of you throughout your visit - much better and more relaxed.

They had bath bombs, foot soaks, dry shampoo (ommggg I bought the 'Godiva' one and it's amazing and super handy because it's easily transportable) They have scrubs, face soap, lotions, conditioners. EVERYTHING. \n\nHere are my loves so far: \n1. Coalface soap - it's black which is a little offsetting, but I bought it because I have oily skin and i've literally been using it for 2 days and I can already see a serious improvement. it is PHENOMENAL. And this store gets 5 stars because of this soap.\n2. Shower bombs - it's a tablet that you place in your shower while you're showering that dissolves, helps you with aromatherapy and also acts as an air-freshener for your bathroom. Hello multitasking. \n\nFYI - All products are natural and without chemicals. They also have organic and vegan products as well. \n\nAside from the awesome products - everyone who works there was super friendly, knew the products and was helpful.

Days away from a big job interview, I did not want to go in looking like a mad scientist, so I headed over to Lush in search of a hair mask. I walked in and presented my situation to the employees working. After being presented with a few possible solutions, I picked out both a hair mask and a new shampoo. I then mentioned to the wonderful gentleman helping me (Donovan, i think) that my skin has also been so incredibly dry I've been waking myself up in my sleep itching until I bleed. He called over another employee--I think his name was Chris?--who then helped me pick out an awesome new olive oil body wash as well as a body butter bar. I was about to pay and go on my merry way, but I decided since the staff had been so awesome thus far, I would ask for their help finding a new face wash. I explained that I had become so dissatisfied with the face wash recommended by my dermatologist, I had been washing my face with hand soap for the last couple weeks (to which they gave a collective gasp). I explained my weird skin, and Chris (I think!) helped me pick out an awesome face wash--the Ultrabland--and a new toner. I finally forced myself to stop, though I could have spent all night there, and they sent me on my way, $100 poorer, but with a few free samples to spare.\n\nA week later and I am a new person. My skin is no longer dry, my face looks better than ever before, and the beer and cognac shampoo is amazing. The hair mask fixed my destroyed locks too. I could not have been happier with my experience at Lush. At no point did I feel like they were trying to force products on me, I just kept asking for more!

Because of this, I have shopped here a couple of times and was moderately disappointed in my purchase each time. \n\nThe first time I went here I got one of their overpriced bars of soap. It spelled good, definitely, but it's soap. No one can smell it on you after like an hour. I thought that because these soaps cost an order of magnitude more than I usually pay, then maybe this would be different. It was not. I don't understand why people spend this much money on soap that doesn't last any longer. Additionally, talking with the sales associate, I had asked her if anyone had ever complimented her on how she smells, wearing Lush products all the time. She said that someone had once, and it was weird. Okay, why is it weird for someone to compliment you on how you smell, when you spend $10+ on a freaking bar of soap? That's like buying a $400 pair of jeans then not wanting people to think your ass looks better. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.\n\nThe next purchasing experience I had at Lush was when I bought bar shampoo and conditioner, which is a pretty rad idea. The sales associate told me that the shampoo would last for a couple months, which it has. She also said the conditioner would last for \"a pretty long time.\" I suppose that is correct, if \"a pretty long time\" = 1 month. What annoyed me most though, was that the conditioner is not very good, especially for the price. Hell, I would even say sometimes I felt like my hair felt worse after conditioning with this thing. I  prefer dollar store conditioner over rubbing that green block labeled as a conditioner on my head.\n\nNow, this is where I should stipulate that I am a male. That being said, I am a male who owes a hair straighter and currently uses $25/bottle bumble and bumble shampoo.

LET ME COUNT THE WAYS:\n\nThis is my best of the best list.\n\nVeganese conditioner: Silicone Free! Smells like lemon pudding\n\nMa Bar Bubble Bar: Smells like chocolate buttery caramel, vanilla & a  with random cubes of brown sugar. Makes incredibly DENSE bubbles.\n\nAngels on Bare Skin: Crushed almonds scrub, leaves skin SUPER smooth. Add a tiny bit of water. Scrub face. Leaves it soft and glowy\n\n\nHoney I Washed the Kids soap. I also keep a bar JUST for the smell in my bathroom. Seriously. One bar makes my whole bathroom smell like toffee, honey and chocolate.\n\nTIP: So you don't waste their soap (since it is expensive) Slice slivers off every week. Just enough for a few showers at a time.\n\nSilky Under wear Dustin Powder: It makes your skin feel SILKY, just like it says... because of the coco butter it contains. Smells like a sweet floral vanilla....no need to wear perfume with this. It is just a nicely scented Talc powder that makes your skin silky....I sprinkle on my bed sheets for a nice treat.TIP: Get a bug puff and sprinkle the powder on it for body application. That way it won't go everywhere\n\nBig: Shampoo that is salt  that melts in your hair and makes HUGE suds. You need very little, maybe a dime sized dab. The foam is stiff and huge and my hair is nice, full and SHINY.....I alternate with ION hardwater (sally's beauty)   These two poo's have made a world of difference using Boston crappy water\n\nButter Ball Bath Bomb: WARNING EXTREME moisture!@ If you are able to take baths but not really into them...this will change your mind. This bomb Smells lovely, softens the water, moisturizes the skin and doesn't leave a mess in the tub. It doesn't change the color of your water of leave petals everywhere. My skin is so soft I can feel the smoothness the next day......\n\nTIP: I pedi and shave when i'm done so I can enjoy nice clean smelling water-you will be smooth as a babys butt!\n\n Ocean Salt: BE CAREFUL. This is a hard core salt scrub. But that is how I like it. For someone like me, who is SCARED of dry skin...this is perfect. Use on dry skin (feet, elbows, knees) or else the salt will melt away........Don't use on face. Plus it has Vodka in it. That's just cool.\n\nBuffy the Backside Slayer: this stuff is great. You can opt to have it in a canister or not. an in-shower body conditioner complete with ex foliation....it's got granules of rice, almonds and aduki beans in a base chock full of cocoa butter. Cocoa butter is terrific for adding moisture to your skin. It makes skin supple and elastic, and the scrubbies scrub away dead skin particles.You don't need a lot, just use your body soap as usual, then take Buffy and run up your arm, torso, legs (great after shaving!) and your bottom. Than rub in.  The water will start beading up on your skin, then rinse off, and towel dry. TIP: Any little piece that falls off, use as a lip exfoliator.\n\n Rock Star: Bar Soap.........I have no idea why they called this Rock Star as it is Barbie Pink, but all I know is it smells awesome fantastic! Like cotton candy cupcakes with vanilla frosting.  I find that it smells better in the shower and next to my sink, than it did in the store. The divine smell lingers in the bathroom after I use it.I can't say it's super moisturizing but it's not drying for my normal to dry skin either\n\nDream Cream- I know people who SWEAR this clears their acne, Exczima  (sp.?) and scars....This cream is perfect when my skin is acting up or my hands need a treat....it has Essential oils and smells like I love the soothing scents of lavender and calamine, so I don't at all mind the scent of this product..........works perfect is my legs are irritated from shaving\n\nCreamy Candy Bubble Bar- This smells sweet and makes a ton of bubbles. TIP:Be sure to put in a nylon knee high, because it separates quickly\n\nFlying Fox Shower Gel: In a hot shower this turns to a honey and then the jasmine and ylang ylang all dancing around in your shower.  Scent last all day\n\nFig and leaves soap : Wicked scent, looks gorgeous, cruelty-free, exfoliates and moisturizes.\n\nAlkmaar Soap: Doesn't smell so good until it gets wets Jasmine, vanilla and floral.......Oh my!\n\nTea Tree Water: Awesome alcohol free toner\n\n\nSo run to Lush. It may be expensive but I think of all the money I burn on cheap stuff trying to find something awesome.

Don't yell at me because I don't want a sales pitch for products I'm not going to use. \n\nA few months back, it was my Lucho break, and I was in a hurry.

I looked at her calmly and said \"I know what I want, and it does not seem to be here.\" She asks what I said to her again. maybe she was hard of hearing?

I was walking past the store and had to figure out where that severe smell was coming from. Who would have thought I would have ended up working there for a year? If you think that the smell is intense just hanging out there for twenty minutes - think about SOAKING in it for eight hours --- to the point where people still tell me I smell like Lush (and I haven't worked there for a year now). \n\nOnce you get past the smell, you can really understand why Lush is so unique. I was really happy to see that there was a lot of attention to vegan,  organic, and natural ingredients. While it is appropriate to mention that not ALL products are 100% vegan, organic, and/or natural - and you should always check on the product sign or in the catalog -- it is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a more diverse offering of beauty options. \n\nOne of the reasons why I'm recommending Lush so highly is that even a year after not working there anymore - I still use almost all Lush products. Having gotten hooked on Lush skincare, specifically, and also having strayed and tried many other brands - I wouldn't put any different brand of skincare on my face. With their skincare, and also somewhat in their haircare, they have a really nice attention to detail. I can tell you from the inside, that the people who develop the products, all the way down to the managers and sales associates -- really care about this brand, and you'd be hard pressed to find someone who worked for Lush who didn't use it in every part of their day. \n\nThat said, these are a few of my favorites that you could check out if you're curious about the Lush cult: \n\nDream Cream body lotion - pretty much everyone's favorite\nEnzymion facial moisturizer\nOcean Salt - a face and body scrub\nLemony Flutter - a cuticle butter, but i use it sparingly as a hand cream.\n[mix the last two together, to create something we used to call Oceany Flutter - it makes your skin rediculously soft]\nAqua Marabalis - almond heaven body scrub butter\nBath Bombs - even if you're not a bath person - TRY it. at least once in your life.\nFlying Fox - anything from this line - the scent is crazy!!\n\nA little tip with the \"overly attentive\" sales associates - I definitely understand how that comes across as too pushy sometimes - it just depends on the sales associate and how grounded they are in their natural interaction when it comes to customers and the product -- some of them are new and getting used to talking to customers about the stuff, so give them a break! Also, if you're one of those people that would rather just browse for a good while- let them know that. They won't be offended. The thing about Lush - is that they really want the staff to know their stuff. They're really trained to be a resource for you about the ingredients and the effects of products on the skin - they study really hard to be experts on Lush body care! They're not always looking to sell sell sell and most would love to chat about whatever.\n\nOne other thing to note about Lush is that they often have special parties - so be sure to ask them if there's one coming up that might be of interest to you !!\n\nWell! I've rambled on about Lush for quite some time now - all I can say is that even if alternative beauty products aren't your thing - it's definitely worth a visit!\n\np.s. if the smell is getting too intense for you -- look for the little glass pepper shakers filled with coffee beans: they reset your sense of smell - so you can clear it up a bit!", "date": "2007-05-16 11:57:49"}, {"review_id": "S4qHWMOeKzMLVL14HDLRjA", "user_id": "dlKCnOIGQSJq13TuWKbPhw", "business_id": "ZpMTJxXE1NLgxjKIIIlGFQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I never understood expensive soap and body products until Lush.

It was kind  of expensive, like $13 for the smaller size, so I asked her how long I could expect the product to last. She said, \"Mine has lasted me about 2 months.\" Then she recommended I purchase a $4 tin to keep the soap in so it would last longer in the shower. I did. I specifically made this purchase because I believed it would last a while and end up being worth the initial cost.\n\nNow, I really like the Buffy bar I bought. It is a hell of an exfoliator and it really does keep my skin moisturized. But do you know how long it lasted me? FIVE SHOWERS.

The multiple use products last a really long time, even if you get the smaller sizes. Example: I got a 3.3oz bottle of shampoo back in March. I've been alternating between that and a 33.8oz bottle of Aussie shampoo purchased at the end of last December, which cost maybe a dollar less. They both work well and smell great, so it seems like the cheaper Aussie would be a better deal, right? Wrong, because the Aussie is half used up and the Lush is still at least 3/4 full.\n\nAnd that lotion from my original review? Yeah, I went back and bought it, because I realized it's going to last forever since you only need a very small amount.", "date": "2010-07-24 17:45:00"}, {"review_id": "1Rsaz8RA6lWbP99gZUvVjQ", "user_id": "d0UepyTaCFSLHf0C2AdjWw", "business_id": "ZpMTJxXE1NLgxjKIIIlGFQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 14, "cool": 1, "text": "Great products, but I hate, hate, hate going into the store- the salespeople are insanely pushy, and it's a real struggle not to come away with much more than you wanted to buy.

Have you tried this one?\" *waves bar of shampoo under my nose*\nMe: *breaks out in coughing fit*\nShopgirl: \"You know, if you buy two shampoo bars, you get a traveling case for free.\"\nMe: \"I *cough* already *wheeze* have one\" *sneeze*\nShopgirl: \"Oh, don't you like the floral scents? Here, try this one, it's greener and all organic!\" \nMe: *dodges shampoo bar, runs for cash register while fumbling for wallet*\nShopgirl #2: \"Hello, can I help-\"\nMe: *overturns table of soaps to delay shopgirl #2, pushes fellow customer in path of shopgirl #3, and feigns laryngitis when confronted by shopgirl #4 before finally making it to register\"\nShopgirl at register: \"Hello, did you-\"\nMe: \"already on the mailing list/dream cream is against my religion/no thank you I'm allergic to strawberries/here's a fifty keep the change\" \n\nAt this point I run out of the store, only to find that my friend, who was smart enough not to go in with me, has been caught by the free hand treatment woman and has one hand covered in goop.

I really, really do. The products are amazing. It's all I use on my face now.\n\nI like that they're all natural. I like that it smells nice, but not over powering. I like that there's a wide enough variety of product that I could figure out what works best for my skin but not so many choices that it's overwhelming. And I like that the products actually work. Really, really well. Amazingly well. Here, feel my face...soft? right? Thanks.\n\nI do not, however, like their staff. It's one thing to be helpful and available. It's another to be asked by everyone in the store, at least once if I need help. No. But thanks. Also, when I get to the register, yes, I found everything I need. Yes, I already have a toner and moisturizer at home. Yes, they're your product.\n\nAnd I want to say that the few times I've actually talked to the sales people they were extremely helpful...but unfortunately, on a few occasions, they didn't totally listen to me. If I tell you I want a daily face wash, please don't show me something that is extremely exfoliating so I should use 1-3 times a week depending on my skin. Good thing I've sold skin care products before so kind of know what I'm talking about.\n\nGranted, I've also had some experiences with their staff where they showed me some product, talked knowledgeably about it and disappeared for a while so I could play. And here's the kicker, they actually listened to my needs.\n\n It probably doesn't help that since I work a 9-5, I can usually only go on the weekend and we all know what Newbury is like on the weekend. The crowds generally put me in a mood where I'm about to self-inflict a twitchy punch to the face. But maybe that's just me.\n\nNow that I have my regular product, I absolutely love it.

I got what I wanted for about 3x the price I expected and a little something I didn't need too.  It occurred to me as I stepped onto the cold hard reality of the sidewalk that I already had 3 of said thing in cheap generic varieties at home.  Shit.\n\nThey really suck you in with their deli style soaps and clever descriptions and names that don't always make much sense (Mange Too?).  The salesgirl was so incredibly perky that I felt I had to perk up to even converse with her.  She gave me a tour of the store, since I was a first timer, and I tried to figure out the difference between Massage Bars and Body Butter Bars...\n\nI did try a (non-bar) moisturizer I liked and was about to toss it into my wicker basket for purchase.  (I don't put anything on my face, generally- not even face wash.)  But then I glanced at the price.  88 FREAKIN' DOLLARS!!!  Actually, $87.95 for 1.5 oz.  I just kept staring at it, trying to figure out if it was supposed to be $8.95 or $7.95 and who had made this crazy mistake...\n\nThey caught me at my weakest, those Lushies- I was trying out some new all-natural, find-it-in-your-kitchen hair care and eating vegan muffins just that morning.  I kind of like the idea behind these products and this company, but I still look down on people that buy them just a tiny bit because they are willing to spend that much money on smelly smelly beauty.\n\nBut I gave in this time, so now I have to look down on myself too.", "date": "2008-04-22 03:48:04"}, {"review_id": "WtRSxggHYOA-5gTlubVCDw", "user_id": "plvIc2Ko4mHFARI6ABHf3Q", "business_id": "ZpMTJxXE1NLgxjKIIIlGFQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I came in here for the first time in my entire life.

Not anymore! I don't know if my Lush love quite counts as an addiction yet, but I do fancy some of their products. The best time to go is during their \"Clean Slate\" blowout sale (occurring right after the holiday season) which offers most products for buy one get 2 free and other special deals. During Clean Slate '08, I picked up some real bargains on massage bars, soaps, hand creams and scrubs. Then, I was hooked. I think I have enough product to last me through 2009! \n\nNow I'm loving the Juicy shampoo (gets your hair squeaky clean and smells like lemonade), and the Veganese conditioner (for super shiny, soft hair). The massage bars are great for extra dry skin because it's almost like lotion with greater staying power, but not greasy. Make sure you get the reusable tins to put them in to keep cool and dry, otherwise they'll melt away super quick. My other favorite is the Lemony Flutter cream--it's a little greasy, but great for chapped winter hands and feet.\n\nLush makes me wish I had a beautiful clawfoot tub just so I can use the amazing bath bombs!  Some of the products are a bit pricey, but just think of it as a little all-natural beauty splurge. Plus, they are very generous with samples if you just want to try before you buy.\n\nExtra props to Lush for not hiring pushy sales staff. The ones I've encountered are always super friendly and helpful. I love the demos. \n\nMinus one star because I find that the soaps often melt away too quickly if you leave them in the shower uncovered. And oftentimes the stores contain so many smelly products that the scents will just knock you back and your nose goes \"WHOA.\" Even when I store my soaps in a paper bag within a plastic bin, the scents always seem to migrate and infiltrate other products.
