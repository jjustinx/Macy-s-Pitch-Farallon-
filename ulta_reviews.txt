Lamb chunks, chopped tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, tzatziki, and onion in flatbread. It was just OK. As far as gyros are concerned, I personally prefer the thicker Greek pita because the sturdiness and pliability of that pita makes it less likely that it'll fall apart on you.\n\nThe tzatziki had a runny consistency, filled with garlic. It also tasted a bit tangier than other tzatzikis I've had. I found it unfortunate that Gus didn't have feta in the cart, since I felt that would have made the gyro experience better.\n\nA few weeks later, I came back and had the breakfast burrito.

I still have to wear glasses for anything from arms' length in, but that's okay - laser vision correction doesn't fix age-related nearsightedness.\n\nIn the face of all these glowing reviews, I feel like the oddball, but there WERE a few aspects of my experience that were negative. Dr. Cunningham wasn't one of them; he was great -  friendly, gave my eyes a thorough examination, answered any and all questions patiently. The office staff is wonderful, and I never had to wait long at all. I met Dr. Dell for about five minutes immediately before my surgery, and he must have been having a bad day because he seemed irritated and rushed.\n\nThey keep patients in a holding area while the pre-op Valium takes effect, and I found myself in the company of a stockbroker, the owner of a basketball team, and a corporate CEO. We talked sports for a while; occasionally one of the guys would disappear and another would take his place. (Definitely a cattle-call feel.) Eventually it was my turn.\n\nYes, they give you a huge teddy bear to hold; you need something to do with your hands.\n\nWhen I was on the table and ready to go, Dr. Dell told me to raise my chin. I raised it a little. He said, \"Raise your chin\" again. I raised it up a little more. Then he snapped loudly 'RAISE YOUR CHIN!\" - and grabbed my chin and jerked it up hard. Gee, I just had some Valium and I only weigh about 110 pounds. If he had said, \"Raise it some more\" or \"Raise it WAY up\" it would have been easier to accommodate him in my drugged state. I didn't pay $6000 to get yelled at. \n\nThe rest of the procedure went well. In the weeks afterward, I had bad reactions to two of the antibiotics, and my apparently very dry eyes were inflamed for months, despite constant administration of eyedrops, both prescribed and OTC. My eyelids were puffy, which I was told was a result of the inflammation, and there is still some swelling underneath that I hope will go away eventually (it's been 10 months). I see well in good light and at distances, but not up close at all without glasses (as expected, not a surprise).\n\nOverall a mixed experience.

Even though I loathed wearing my glasses and could no longer wear contact lenses due to chronic dry eye, I refused to consider getting surgery to correct my nearsightedness.  Even though I've had several friends over the years who have raved about the improved quality of life they experienced after surgery, I just couldn't get past the fear.  What if I was in that tiny percentage with a bad outcome? Why would I want to gamble with my eyes for an elective procedure? \n\nThe cure to my fear was finding the highest rated doctor I could afford with the most stringent patient acceptance criteria. I figured that a guy who cares a great deal about his success statistics wouldn't choose me as a patient if I'm not a great candidate. Plus, as a teaching and testing facility, the office would have access to the latest and greatest gadgetry to increase the accuracy of the procedure as well as my comfort. A practice that is good enough for Olympians and astronauts has gotta be good enough for me, right? Seeing all the glowing reviews on Yelp and the risk-free consultation gave me the push I needed to check out Dell Laser Consultants.\n\nDr. Dell's team took a few hundred different measurements of my eyes (many that I'd never experienced before, even though I've been visiting the eye doctor every 6-12 months for the past 20+ years). Both he and Dr. Cunningham discussed several different issues with my eyes and lifestyle changes I could make and meds to take to improve them. I learned that I (like most women beyond their 20s) needed to get on a high dose of Omega 3s to combat dry eye, and to become fanatical about wearing sunglasses at all times when outdoors. I also found out that a red eye condition I'd had for years was actually a bacterial infection that could be cleared up with the right antibiotic - huh, wonder why my \"regular\" eye doc didn't catch that before?\n\nAfter careful consideration of all the variables and some preliminary treatment for my dry eyes, they gave me the green light to proceed to a glasses-free face for the first time since 7th grade. Since I'd been out of contacts for years already, I didn't have to wait long. From first consult to surgery, it was less than a month (and this delay was more about my schedule than his).\n\nIt's now been 2 weeks, and I am very happy with the results. I went from -5.5 (R) /  -4.75 (L) correction to 20/15 (R) and 20/20 (L) vision, and my sight is expected to continue to improve over the next several weeks. I love being able to wear cute sunglasses and see in the shower and distinguish my loved ones' faces from the across the room. When summer rolls back around, it will be great to go to the pool, lake, beach, etc. and have no need for glasses. Snow skiing and SCUBA diving with no worries about contact lens mishaps - yay!\n\nNow my biggest eye worries are the dark circles and fine lines around my eyes that are no longer camouflaged by glasses frames.

Needless to say, I was done! I had loved the idea and convenience of LASIK, but the thought of someone messing with my eyes completely scared me.  It wasn't until I recently started having serious problems keeping my contacts in and/or comfortable that I decided to check my options.  \n\nMy regular eye doctor recommended Dr. Dell so I made an appointment as soon as possible.  Prior to the appointment, I researched Dr. Dell. He's the best of the best in my opinion.  He has the latest technology and many years experience.  He and his colleague Dr. Cunningham are also the most strict/conservative with whom they deem as \"good candidates\". In fact when I went for my first consultation, Dr. Cunningham advised me that I wasn't fit for surgery at that point.  He provided a 2 week supply of lubricated drops (along with instructions to wear only glasses) to combat my dry eyes and abnormal corneas.  After the 2 week period, I was nervous to hear the verdict.  To my surprise, I was approved for \"flapless\" LASIK (better for my particular eyes than traditional LASIK) and eagerly scheduled my procedure for the next week!  \n\nThe morning of my advanced surface ablation (ASA) I was anxious to say the least, but the friendly staff helped me feel at ease.  My eyes were tested one last time, photos were taken of my irises, and then I met Dr. Dell for the first time.  He kindly introduced himself, answered any questions I had, double checked all of the numbers, and ordered my Valium to help me relax.  After about 30 minutes, I was feeling good and it was time.  I was escorted to the procedure room with Dr. Dell and Dr. Cunningham, was told to stare at a red light, and about 5 minutes later it was done.  And my husband got to watch it all from outside the room. Seriously. It was that simple.  \n\nWith ASA (or PRK), instead of cutting a flap and then closing it back up...they completely remove the flap and then place a nonprescription contact on top as a bandage until the cells/flap regenerate.  Because the flap is removed, it requires a longer recovery period before your vision is good.   I had my procedure on a Thursday and it wasn't until Monday that I could legally drive.  It was a little blurry, but I could see enough. About 20/40.  It wasn't until day 10 or so that I started seeing pretty sharply 20/25 or so.  I am now about 6 weeks post ASA and I am seeing clearer and farther than I ever have - 20/10.  It's truly amazing!\n\nI would highly recommend DLC to anyone considering vision correction surgery.

I HATE glasses and I wore contacts for 16+ hours a day for 15 years.  I finally had Custom Wavefront Intralase in September 2010.  The surgery itself was incredibly fast (and almost surreal actually).  \n\nDr. Dell, Dr. Cunningham, and the entire Dell Laser Consultants staff were absolutely fantastic.  I was referred to DLC by a friend, and quite honestly, after my first consultation I was slightly put off by the cost of the surgery.  DLC is priced higher than other clinics, but after researching Dr. Dell's reputation, I was completely comfortable with spending a little extra because I was confident that I was putting my vision in the hands of one of the leading ophthalmologists in the country.  Additionally, during my pre-op visit it was obvious that they offer very personalized service.  I've been to DLC five times now for pre and post op visits and each time they have greeted me by name, walked me back into one of the patient rooms almost immediately, and Dr. Cunningham has promptly come in to exam my eyes and answer any questions.  No crowded or noisy offices, no long waits, no rushed appointments.  They encourage you to ask questions and to come in if you have any concerns even if it's in between a regularly-scheduled appointment.  \n\nThe day of the surgery both Dr. Cunningham and Dr. Dell came in to make sure that I had no additional questions or concerns.  Dr. Dell explained the procedure again and during the surgery he and the nurses (assistants?) explained every step of the process as they were doing it.  Their explanations and encouragements definitely helped calm my nerves during the procedure.\n\nWhen I walked out of the surgery my vision was foggy but already better than my pre-surgery uncorrected vision.  The next day I was at about 20/30 and one week later I'm at 20/20 (20/25 with my left eye alone) and I'm expecting the clearness and crispness to continue to improve over the next few weeks.  I've experienced no pain what-so-ever and dryness has been pretty minimal (or at least less than I expected).  The most bothersome aspects of the whole process were wearing glasses for three weeks prior to the surgery and wearing the safety glasses to sleep for the first week after the surgery (to prevent from rubbing your eyes).  \n\nI highly recommend Dell Laser Consultants for your vision correction surgery.

I struggled with my contacts and glasses for 20 years, before finally deciding to do some research and commit to LASIK. First, I looked into LASIK Plus, despite their bargain of a price, I was hesitant to commit to going with them, because their optometrist told me I only had to be out of my contacts for four days before the procedure, which was significantly shorter than the two weeks my best friend (an optometrist) recommended. My friend said your cornea changes shape due to contacts and the longer you are out of contacts before the procedure the better; therefore, LASIK Plus was ruled out. I then went to Dr. Dell's for a free consultation, but thought the cost was a little more than we could bear. So, I went to Dr. Shawn Wong's office, because I had read some positive reviews about him and he was about $2,000.00 less then the Dell Laser Clinic. After meeting Dr. Wong and finding him to be more than competent, I booked appointments for a pre-op and the surgery. However, after further consultation with my optometrist friend and some reading online, I found that Dr. Wong uses a microkeratome (i.e., not a laser, but rather an oscillating blade) to cut the cornea. Some studies showed that people who underwent the microkeratome reported to have an increase in dry eyes as compared to patients that had Intralase (bladeless) LASIK. You should really read up on the differences between Intralase and microkeratome to make your own decision. \n\nSo, I returned to Dell Laser Clinic to see Dr. Cunningham for my pre-op. I found him to be thorough and truly concerned about treating my dry eyes. He prescribed some artificial tears to treat my eyes; however, we found out they were not covered by my insurance and were a whopping $800.00 for a three month supply. Both Dr. Cunningham and the staff at Dell Laser Clinic worked with the pharmacy, my insurance, and me to find an alternative that I could afford.  \n\nFinally: the procedure. On Thursday, I arrived at the Dell Laser Clinic and was greeted by the friendly staff. A final check of my eyes was done by Dr. Dell (who was approachable and obviously very competent). I was given two chewable tablets of Valium to put me at ease. Then after about 30 minutes of waiting for the Valium to take effect I was guided over to the operating table (which is like a dentist's chair) and the procedure began. I was asked to stare at a light (I think it was a red circle) and within minutes it was over. It probably lasted no more than 1.5 minutes per eye. Fortunately, one of the assistants does a count down when you have about twenty seconds left to let you know it is almost over. Also, Dr. Dell and the assistants continually assured me everything was going well, which was really comforting, because I felt like my eyes were not staying perfectly still (which turns out not to matter, because apparently the laser follows your eyes - I'm not suggesting for you to purposely let your eyes wander). \n\nThe next day I went for my post-op with Dr. Cunningham. He said I was a foggy 20/20, but it would likely only get better. I feel like they have gotten better. For the first time since the third grade, I can go to the bathroom at night without bumping into things or tripping over shoes. Also, it takes some getting use to, like not reaching for your glasses in the morning or feeling like you have to take your contacts out before you accidentally fall asleep with them in. The only issue now is to keep following my eye drop schedule and to wear the eye goggles Dr. Dell gave me. You're instructed to tape these to your face so you don't inadvertently scratch your eyes while you are sleeping. I don't recommend taping as dramatically as I did - it hurt like heck to take them off after the first night. Now, I am still wearing the goggles to bed, fortunately though my eyes do not itch at all and I feel no urge to rub them.  \n\nWell, I am certainly glad I chose Dell Laser Consultants for my procedure.

Rather, given our age (50) and eyesight (bad), only refractive lens replacement would provide us the crisp distance, reading and intermediate vision we wanted.  As she put it, only \"cataract surgery without the cataracts\" would give us the result we wanted.

I am 66 and had developed cataracts over just a few years.  My doctor did not think a new prescription would last more than a few months as my cataracts worsened.\nI had my first appointment and exhaustive testing and inspection of my eyes followed by consultation and exam by Dr Cunningham and then by Dr Dell.  My eyes were too dry to get the necessary measurements for cataract lens replacement, so I was given recommendations for eye drops and told to take fish oil in high dose to improve my dry eye condition.\nI went back about 4 weeks later and was told my eyes were better, but still not good enough.\nSo they told me I would need Lipiflow treatment.  That sounded fine until I was told it would cost about $900 plus the cataract surgery would cost $3200 per eye plus the cost of the lens out of pocket after Medicare and my supplement.  I was in shock.  I scheduled the appointments, but wasn't sure I wouldn't cancel them later. At the desk on my out, was my first experience with anyone not being warm and welcoming.  As soon as I asked any questions, they became short and rude, I felt.\nI decided to proceed after checking with two other eye centers who would not give me a real quote over the phone, but did indicate my procedures would be similarly priced.\nI went back for the LipiFlow treatment and afterwards was examined by Dr Varu, I believe.  I asked her a lot of questions including why the price was so much more than I had expected from my friends' experiences and from the internet research I had done.  She explained the differences in types of lens and expected outcomes, but clearly was not happy about my questions.  She did answer them patiently, but as briefly as possible, I felt.\nI was told I would need three prescription eye drops after the surgery.  I wasn't sure if my insurance would cover them, so I purchased the all-in-one mixture they sold themselves.  Another unexpected $185 not covered by insurance.\nI had the procedure done on both eyes by Dr Dell at the Texas Surgery Center.  I had to pay $650 at the center for each lens on the day of surgery.  Fortunately, that was the only pain and suffering involved.\nThe Surgery Center was crowded, but I was treated very well there. You are called back to a prep area, given a pill to relax you, given 7 different eye drops 3 times and then an IV is inserted in your hand.  You are taken back to surgery in a wheel chair.  I was given a sedative through the IV, but honestly I don't remember anything about the surgery at all. Lens were replaced with Tecnis Multifocal lens.  Absolutely no issues with the procedures.  Recovery was straight forward.  They take you back to the prep area, check you out, give you a drink and a snack and send you out to get in the car with whoever drives you home.  \nI slept all afternoon and slept well that night with a plastic shield over my eye.  Had my right eye done and one week later, my left eye was done.  Both eyes were pretty good the next morning, but both are now performing very well.  No glasses needed for vision--near, intermediate or at distance.  No pain or irritation.  Most notable are the vivid colors I now see.  The world is brighter and much more colorful.  The multifocal lens are working as advertised. \nJust had my final appointment with my eye doctor today, four weeks after surgery.  My doctor was shocked at how good my eyes were.  He said he had never seen someone which such good vision after the surgery.  Nice job, Dr. Dell.\nIn short, I am very pleased with the treatment and results.  Very disappointed in the price which was more than twice what I had been told to expect for this procedure by others and through my internet research, but it looks like you get what you pay for.

I've worn eye glasses and soft contacts ever since I was 15yrs old, and have noticed a deterioration in my eyesight over the past several years.  My contact prescription had gone from -2.25 (in high school) to a current -4.0.  That's nearly double the deterioration, and that basically means I am more of a hazard driving on the road than any 90yr old bifocal-wearing senior citizen.

My friend recommended Dell Laser Consultants since she also had a friend who was an eye doctor on his staff.  I knew they had a great reputation, so I opted to go for it.  \n\nThe staff is very professional and thorough, after a few tests they said I would be the perfect candidate for a lasik procedure w/ their new German Laser.  I was looking forward with anticipation and eager to cherish the results - up until the day of the procedure when I started to get some butterflies and anxiety.   But that's when I met Dr. Dell himself who went through my files and performed some eye tests.  He told me that I had nothing to worry about and that I would have perfect eyesight as a result of this procedure.  His reassurance calmed my nerves and my confidence was restored. \n\nThe procedure only took a few minutes and was painless!  After wards I was given eye protection and a prescription drug to help me sleep for the next few hours (at home).  After a 5 hr nap I woke up to the best feeling in the world - - perfect eyesight without any glasses or contacts! \n\nDr. Dell was off in one area - - the procedure did not result in perfect 20/20 vision.  Instead - much to my surprise - at my follow up appointment I found out that I have better than 20/20 vision - - 20/15 in one eye and 20/12 in the other to be exact!  That puts me in the top 5 percentile of eyesight patients!  It was honestly the best investment I have made to date, other than my college education.

Just ask him--he'll tell you.  haha.  Seriously, he's experienced.  His staff is friendly for the most part.  I recently had cataract surgery (April, 2017).  It was one of the most distressing experiences of my life--and I'm no weenie.  (I've birthed five babies, all but one without drugs).  Bottom line:  The optimal situation is finding a doctor who is knowledgable/skilled, and one whom you can talk to and she/he will listen, address your concerns, and make you feel at ease and confident.  If I had to choose, I'd pick skill....and you DO have to choose at Dell Laser.  Neither doctor I saw (Dr. Dell or Dr. Cunningham) could easily crack a smile; Both were all business, and I never felt at ease in their office.  Surgery day is a cattle call.  20 or more patients are lined up in a surgery center.  And it's assembly line time.  NO VALIUM.  And I waited 2-3 hours for my surgery, even though I was there a few minutes before my assigned time.   I didn't see Dr. Dell for more than\n10 minutes until surgery; day of, he walked by me without even saying boo. I was anxious, and  a short greeting with maybe, \"We'll take good care of you\", would have soothed my nerves.\n\nSome suggestions/advice for any of you needing cataract surgery:\n1) Discuss lens options.  There ARE options.....Steven Dell has a vested interest in at least one, as he helped invent/did research and training on a Technis lens.\n2)  Steven Dell has a dry sense of humor (read \"smart ass\")....Don't be put off.  He's socially awkward as many bright science types are.  He seems in a hurry.  Like I said, if you want a doctor you can talk with, he ain't it.  \n3)  All cataract surgeons prescribe 2 years of eye drops, some expensive--OK, not 2 years, just a month to 6 weeks following surgery (and 2-4 weeks before).  Costco had the best prices.   \n4)  No matter WHAT lens you choose, you may need glasses and /or LASIK afterwards.  This is disclosed in paperwork (i.e., may need glasses), but I didn't take it seriously, especially since no one mentioned it, and I didn't ask.  Don't expect 20/20 vision; a few attain it, but as few as 20%.  \n5)  DRY EYE is a BIG problem for most people following cataract surgery or lasik and can cause lots of discomfort, not to mention decrease vision acuity big time!!   The eye drops Dr. Cunningham prescribed only made it WORSE (Xiidra).  What worked GREAT for me is a Thermalon eye mask you heat up in the microwave and wear 5 minutes every morning while sipping morning coffee or whatever....(AMAZON, $10...and thank you to Dr. Donna Shepherd of Austin Vision for this tip)  Also, turn off ceiling fans at night.\n6)  Be wary of some $900 or so procedure for cleaning the eyelids before surgery.  Not necessary.\n7)  Find a doctor for this important procedure who is both skilled and will make you feel comfortable.

So I did my homework and read up.  In September I went in for a consultation.  The initial consultation went very smoothly, she did some eye scans and I was informed that I was not considered a candidate for Lasik (not surprising as I was around -10D) but that I was an excellent candidate for ASA.  She walked me through the scans and explained what they showed.  I had a tough schedule to work around for doing the actual surgery and Emily was wonderful, she worked with me (and around my ridiculous schedule) to find a date that worked for me this fall as I knew I would have any other opportunities for this for at least a year.  Emily is great, when I had an allergic reaction to one of the drops she made sure I got to talk to Dr. Cunningham and called in the new prescription for me.\n\nWhen I came back in October for my pre op scans I met Dr. Cunningham.  He walked me through the procedure and my scans and told me everything I needed to know and then proceeded to answer my ridiculous questions.  He was very personable and approachable and made me feel comfortable with the surgery.  As I had high myopia naturally I was concerned about my prognoses.  He explained that despite my poor vision I was a good candidate because it was about the capacity of correction within the retina and that based on my retinas I should expect to end up at 20/20.  Anything worse, he said, would be considered unacceptable and a disaster by them.  I was warned about potential side effects while healing (light sensitivity, pain, etc.) and told how to cope with these.  He also handled me immediately before surgery, confirming the scans and immediately after to make sure things went smoothly, the surgery went swimmingly.  \n\nI met Dr. Dell just before the surgery, he came in to go over any lingering concerns I might have and to explain the procedure to me.  He told me about some of the drops they use to prevent corneal haze and some other interesting things about the industry.  He told me exactly what they would be doing while I was in the surgery room, down to all the drops they were putting in my eyes before and after. When I was walked into the surgery room there was no doubt in my mind that he was the best. \n\nOverall this team was great and I would recommend them to anyone.

I was disappointed that I did because it made me second guess my decision. However, I moved forward and believe that these negative reviews are without merit for those who are interested in top treatment for what can be a nerve-wracking procedure. Let me share my experience: \n\nAfter deemed a candidate and if you decide to move forward, here's what to expect: \n1) Stop wearing contacts about 10-14 days before surgery\n2) A pre-surgery meeting prior to surgery (mine was the week of) with Dr. Cunningham. \n3) The actual Lasik surgery date with Dr. Dell (usually on a Thursday)\n4) A post-op meeting with Dr. Cunningham the following day. \n\nAll of my appointments started promptly on time and the staff couldn't have been more friendly. Throughout each step the procedure was explained and I was patiently asked for any questions I may have. There are several steps of instructions in terms of prescriptions you need to get prior to surgery. During my morning of surgery, while in the waiting room, I overheard that most other patients had a hard time following through on the requirements so I gained special appreciation for the staff who had to reiterate the instructions and find creative solutions for those patients. \n\nThe meeting with Dr. Cunningham the week of surgery was great. He clearly explained the procedure and checked for questions. Continued to set my expectations and check for questions. His role is to ensure that there are no issues before or after surgery.\n\nThe day of surgery was awesome. Melissa walked me through the prep and she was so personable, friendly and again showed that she really cared that I was comfortable. Dr. Dell was the same way, very relaxed and reassured me that I was a great candidate. \n\nIf nothing else, I want to share that the procedure itself was so easy! I was worried it'd be extremely uncomfortable or scary. It wasn't. You don't feel a thing and you watch your vision improve before your eyes. It's awesome. Also, there are at least two additional nurses in the room with you and they reassure you and coach you the whole way. \n\nAll this to say that if you choose Dr. Dell and Dell Laser Consultants you'll be pleased with the experience and outcome.

I have never had a fantastic experience in the terms of customer service. They tend to greet who they think may spend more money. Why do I say this? Because they can ignore me and my makeup-less, laundry day look but greet someone behind me with a Chanel bag. All that aside, I still shop at Ulta because It's a great place to get a bunch of things I need in one place. They also have items that drugstores don't. I had been to other Ulta stores and was disappointed with the selection being so different in store than online. I went to the Orlando Waterford Lakes store the very same day and it wasn't a great experience. My family and I were on our way this direction and decided to go to this one. I am so glad I did! I walked in and three people said hello, asked me if I needed help and told me not to hesitate to ask if I couldn't find something. The store is very large and not at all packed so tightly that you can't walk through. Super large selection. I found three things at this store that the Orlando didn't have. My mom was at both stores with me and commented how much nicer this store was. It was organized and spacious. I went to the check out and waited behind one person. The check out person was super friendly, sweet, very smiley and asked me if I found everything I needed. I had trouble finding my card and she was not at all annoyed. She chit chatted with me until i found it. Here's the honest truth. I have severe anxiety and shopping makes me feel very self conscious. If I feel cramped in a store, rushed by clerks and feel as if they would rather me not be there, then I usually would just leave without spending money. This store visit was painless and even made easier due to the customer service.

Clean store.  Great selection.  I find the level of customer service to be very hit or miss.   I stop by fairly often.  When I am dressed nicely with my hair done, I get incredible service.  When I am casually dressed or without makeup, I'm all but ignored.  \nI walked in and was greeted warmly by the cashier.  I headed to grab a couple things.  A couple of other employees were having a very personal conversation nearby.  They did not look in my direction as I went from aisle to aisle trying to find the items. When I did ask for help, they looked bothered, as if I had interrupted them. I asked for the item, they looked at each other then one replied rephrasing my exact words.  She then pointed to a few aisles over and went back to her conversation.  I stood there for a minute and then said, \"Ok. I'll go try to find it.\"  \nLater I came across a different couple.  I was asking about a particular shade.  The one lady recommended a shade and dismissed any concerns I had in a rather rude way.  I asked if I could try it and she told me she would do it.  She proceeded to do one eyebrow and I loved it.  Then she walked away with the tester.  So here I am with one eyebrow done and the other not done.  I looked crazy.  I went to checkout.  Again a very happy conversation happening with employees but zero engagement with any of the customers.  Three of us in line listened as they complained about other employees and teased each other about makeup knowledge.  \nThe shining star was my cashier Kaylee.  I went on another day and she was the only one jumping in to answer questions and proactively troubleshoot.  She gave me great recommendations and asked about my preferences.  She was kind and patient.  She asked for help from another employee who was holding an iPad.  That person came over and pointed to where Kaylee had to go from her station at the register.  I felt that person could have gotten the item.  When I told that person I felt the service was lacking, she didn't have much of a response.  I explained Kaylee was great and she did not acknowledge my compliment.  \nIt's sad that Ulta has become one of those places that I don't expect good service.

I think it's common to wake up during local anesthesia but it's also possible to keep the patient asleep. Who wants to watch & hear their eye lens being scooped out. I felt it, my eye stung & I saw the instruments & Dr Dell told me loudly to look at the light as I flinched & my hand shook during surgery. He is all business. There were many patients being operated on, a huge waiting room full, with just 1 doctor doing all those surgeries every 15 minutes or so. Dr Dell's back was turned when I entered the O.R., his back was turned when I left. He recommended the Tecnis lens that I paid over $3K extra for out of pocket which does not work well. I can't see near or far, it's self-adjusting, I need reading glasses now. I was told it may not work, tho & I took the chance but think Dr Dell should have realized with my age that I was not the best candidate. He helped in the development of the lens. I also did not care for his optometrist Dr Jeffrey Lane who doesn't listen well & denies your eye exam results seeming to want to write a perfect result down when I said the letters were blurry. I have considered however that maybe another doctor would not have had a better result, that perhaps that was the best result possible given my advanced age. I have no one to compare Dr Dell to for eye treatment. It is possible also to wake up during a local anesthesia & that was not Dr Dell's fault but I think he should have called the anesthesiologist into the OR who was just outside in the prep room since I was showing signs of stress. It is important to have a good surgeon over a caring one. He has a good reputation but we lay-patients don't really know how to evaluate a doctor even though we write these reviews. We don't have the true means to compare the expertise of one to another. All we have to go on is our own experience & what others say. So this could be the surgeon of the ages as his publicity says or it could be that he is just one of many good ophthalmologists who has put himself out there more through research, teaching & writing which enhances his reputation.

I've spent ~$7,500 getting my vision corrected and to be honest, for 4.5 years, it was great. But now, my eyesight has gone downhill again and DLC doesn't seem to be willing to provide any decent service. Frankly, it feels like they could care less and the onus is on me to ensure I figure out the best plan for my eye health.\n\nIn recent months, the customer service from everyone I've interacted with at DLC has been particularly bad. I've finally decided to seek another eye doctor not only in hopes of finding better service but also to seek out a second opinion as the route that DLC put me on has some drawbacks and I can't actually talk to anyone there to get feedback unless I schedule another appointment and fork over another $175.\n\nThe other negative reviews citing the rudeness and attitude from all of the staff are on point.\n\nHere are my recent experiences with 2 (expensive) appointments and the associated interactions.\n\n1) I was given 3 prescriptions and when I went to fill them, the pharmacy called me and let me know that my insurance required pre-authorization. I called DLC and left them a message (because no one answers the phone unless you use the 6, 3 combo). No one called back for 3 days so I called in again. I eventually learned that to get anyone on the phone, you had to use the 6,3 combo on the menu to get to the receptionist.\nThis person will initially always try to transfer you but it's just to the same line that you would reach if you used the \"appropriate\" menu combo. These lines all have a message instructing you to leave a voicemail and that they'll call you back -- but they NEVER call you back.\nEventually, I was able to get the receptionist to tap someone on the shoulder in that other department and ask them to answer the phone when she transferred me.\nThis pre-auth issue eventually got resolved but it took several calls on my part to DLC to get any help and, needless to say, the interactions with the staff at DLC are not pleasant.\n\n2) One of the prescriptions ended up being extremely expensive ($3,000 per year out of pocket) so I called DLC back to see if they could offer any guidance / alternatives without me having to make another appointment and pay another $150 just to get a different prescription.\nSame rigamarole with the phone menu and not getting called back, explaining to the receptionist that I didn't want to leave another voicemail, and finally I got some help.\nThe feedback I eventually got was that they'd call in another prescription for a different eye drop to the pharmacy -- but no indication if this changed how I should take the other prescribed medicine and frankly, I didn't want to go through the trouble of trying to talk to someone at DLC again to find out. At this point, I was considering getting a second opinion and also annoyed with how difficult it was to talk to anyone at my current doctor and feeling like I was really on my own to figure out what to do for my eyesight and eye health.\n\n3) Insult to injury -- the other day, I get a bill in the mail from a collections agency because I owe $90 to DLC (apparently). I would have certainly paid this to DLC had anyone from the organization made any attempt to let me know that I owed them money. I received no emails, no phone calls, no voice mails, no text messages, no physical mail -- I'm pretty sure they made no attempt to contact me about this balance and instead turned it over to collections.\nI had 2 recent appointments. When I went in for the first one, I paid $75 up front. When I went in for the second one, they let me know that insurance didn't cover enough of the first one and that I had an outstanding balance so upon this second visit, I paid for the second appointment and this extra balance from the prior appointment to the tune of $181.\nSo at this point, we're looking at about $128 per appointment and assuming that both appointments have been fully paid for.\nThis new $90 charge brings the cost up to $173 per visit.\nMy 6,3 combo magic didn't work this time - when I called in and explained that I've left voicemails to no avail before, she said she'd find someone and be right back but then just transferred me to the billing voicemail.\nEDIT: They had my old address and had mailed statements to it. This got resolved but I would think they might try another way to contact me before handing it over to collections.\n\n4.5 years of good vision, ~$7,500, now it's time to start over elsewhere.", "date": "2019-02-04 16:41:13"}, {"review_id": "peeW3ci-o04LuqDBdQyqzA", "user_id": "W9uy_sfJMCkBFuJb9c-kBQ", "business_id": "9DcC4MbJ9egYd1zmsLxhcw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "All was well until we met the doctor for my husband's first time at the office.

It's been about 3 months since I've had the surgery and the healing process is supposed to take up to 6 months, but I feel I should write a review now and update it later.\n\nI've been wearing glasses or contacts for about 10 years, though looking back I probably should have been wearing them a bit earlier. I got tired of glasses after about a year and stuck with contacts only -- and I must admit I wasn't the best with them, regularly leaving them in overnight while camping or waiting way too long to change them out.  \n\nFinally, after turning 24, I had decided I've had enough with contacts and glasses and decided to get LASIK. I spent the next few months researching all the different procedures, mainly various forms of LASIK and implants.  \n\nEverything went flawlessly. The office is in an office park right off Mopac and Bee Caves by Westlake. The office staff is very friendly and will accommodate you even if you're a dumbass like myself and miss an appointment.  \n\nThe procedure is fairly straightforward:\n\nYou'll go there for the initial consultation, have your eyes tested by this really cool machine that scans the topography of your eyes and more to see what your actual vision is like, along with several other eye tests.  If you've been deemed to be fit for the surgery, you'll get scheduled for another appointment. \n\nAt this second appointment, you'll have those same tests run on you again, then you'll get to meet the doctor, which will likely be Dr. Derek Cunningham. Google his credentials 'cause I don't have space to write them in here but he's a damn fine doctor. He comes in, inspects your eyeball-machine-papers, does a standard eye inspection, and fields your questions and concerns in a friendly helpful manner. \n\nIt's been a couple weeks now since your last visit  You've not been wearing contacts since then, and you've been applying fake tears daily.  It's now time for the surgery... boogaboogaboo!\n\nNah it's not that bad at all. You come in, have one more cursory eye check, and meet with Dr. Dell. I found this kind of interesting since I'm an Austin native and my first PC was a Dell computer back in the early 90s when there was a Dell Outlet here, but that's beside the point. You meet up with him, go over the charts and info, then take some valium and hang out for about half an hour in a little lounge.  I didn't really want the valium 'cause it makes me feel like crap but it supposedly makes your eyeballs better for being lasered so eh.\n\nAfter about half an hour hanging out in the lounge waiting for the valium to kick in you're called into the surgical room. You lie back on some kind of medical foldy chair thing with Dr. Dell and several students hovering around you.  On top of one of your eyes is placed a thing that creates a lot of suction and you're told to look into the red light. All of the sudden the red light becomes very blurry, then it comes back into focus, and then you repeat with your other eye. Then you're done.\n\nThat's it. The whole procedure takes maybe 2 minutes (though the consultation and all that takes quite a bit more time).  But viola, you have awesome vision now.  You have to wear these annoying goggles for a week when you sleep and put eye drops in all the time for a little while but that's not too big of a deal.\n\nAs I've said, it's been about 3 months since I had the surgery so let me update you on my current status and give you a little info of what to expect:\n\nDay of/after: OH GOD EVERYTHING IS SO BRIGHT \nWeek after: Can go outside, but still very bright. Nevertheless... I've never seen this clearly.\nA couple months after: Had the second post-op checkup, I'm at 20/15 vision. I have never seen this clearly before ever. I can identify the make / model of passenger jets flying 50,000ft over my house (I live by an airport).  Every leaf in my neighbors yard 200m away is clearly visible.  This is the most incredible sunset I have ever seen -- large anvil cumulonimbus with cirrus floating overhead, the sky is a dazzling fiery orange by the light of the setting sun, crisper than I could ever imagine... beautiful.\n\nOne issue: Night vision sucked. Terribly. Anything that was a pure white shifted to a shade of some kind of light sea green. My night vision was pretty awful -- the first time I drove a decent distance at night was terrifying.  It's been 3 months though, and already my night vision has improved to basically what it was before the surgery.  Apparently there's a scattering effect due to the change of the cornea and lense that heals over time, which it has.\n\nAgain, I'll update this after my 6 months of healing, but for now I give them 5 stars.

So much so that I decided after more than 4 or 5 years of NOT getting my hair professionally cut because I have long hair past my waist and every stylists thinks they know better than the customer and wants to cut more than I ask them to, this one just seemed right. My last hair stylist changed salons and a hair cut and tip went from 75 to over $100, I could barely afford the first price so I just trimmed my own hair - it's straight and easy, but I did need a clean up as my puppy last year decided to give my hair a trim and chewed my hair while she was in my lap and I lost about 8 inches or so. I didn't think it was that noticiable so I keep going, without a hair cut.\n\nAnyway, long story short - if you need a hair cut or color or whatever - go see Kim Hysong at the Waterford Lakes Ulta.

He asked if I was ready and I said YES! \nWhen he chopped through he asked me why I chose to cut all my hair off and I said, because I want to try something new and donate my hair - he was REALLY confused. Donate your hair? to who? I explained the Locks of Love and he was clueless then explained how they don't do that on Tuesdays.. REALLY?????\n\nSo he takes me to the back to wash my hair and I am on the verge of tears. Another woman who just cut her hair shorter and he bragged how I had just cut 14\" off. Then he starts to tell me how terrible my hair is, asked if I had hard water, or dyed it all the time. I said no - and felt even worse then I did 5 mins before. We walk back to his station and he gets out a comb, starts to comb my hair and says, \"girl - what have you done to your hair?!? it's the worst I've ever seen - are you sure you don't do anything to it? this is just isn't gonna work\" and THREW the comb in to the corner and got out a brush - humiliated.\n\nWhen finished, even though I realized that there were parts uneven - I kept my mouth shut and knew I could trim my own hair at home. The whole reason I went was to treat myself (which I could hardly afford) after a 7 week stay in a hospital where I had to put my long locks in to a bun every day - just so I could feel pretty again.\n\nWhen I was paying she asked if I wanted to make another appiontment - HA! are you kidding!??!?!?!?

The times that I have visited something has always gone wrong or has been sour. More specifically, the employees at this location are people you want to avoid. \n\nOn one occasion they charged me twice for the same shampoo and conditioner, but I did not realize this until I got home. Because I do not live in the vicinity, I returned to the store about 25 days later to get my money back and to pick up a few other things. The manager gave me a hard time about the receipt and said \"why didn't you come sooner?\" I notified her that I had called the store the same night to notify them of THEIR mistake, and I was told to keep my receipt for a refund. The manager reluctantly (and with major attitude) told me that she would be back and left me at the counter. She returned half an hour later. She notified me that she had to review the security tapes to see what happened on that day. She then stated that because I had asked the sales person about a product during the transaction, I threw her off-which must have caused her to ring up the items twice. I laughed my ass off. Terrible excuse and unprofessional service. \n\nOn another occasion, Ulta sold me a bad CHI Deep Waver. It was on the Sale rack-but the sales associate stated that they had never been used-they were just making room for new merchandise. When I got home, the inside product was missing. In addition the machine stopped working 62 days after I purchased it. I took the product back in the box to exchange the product. I have an Ulta beauty card-but the employees stated that there was no record of me buying the product because the beauty history erases every 60 days. How stupid. Also, the employee kept suggesting to me that I had not purchased the product recently because she \"hadn't seen those in a while.\" Uhhh, then you must not know your merchandise well. I pulled up my bank statement to show the employees that I had made a purchase, but even then they stated that they could not use that information to help me return the product.

I busied myself over at the men's area. \n\nPer my quick tip at the time, Ulta did have a surprisingly comprehensive selection of men's skin care products from Redken, Clinique for men, and Jack Black. I love how they have to package guys' lotions in dull, grey bottles as to not offend their sense of masculinity, although I don't see too many straight men dolling out $24 for eye cream. Also, I was surprised Jack Black had expanded from hit-or-miss comedy into skin care. I guess that's one way to go. \n\nThe salesgirls were really professional and friendly, which I find at odds with some other reviews. They vouched for the brand of brush my friend had decided upon, and also signed her up for some sort of Ulta rewards card that earns points towards free stuff, so that was helpful. \n\nI didn't buy anything (my vanity already looks like a Saks counter), but I did do what I normally do in these stores, and sprayed on the colognes that reminded me of my exes.

I have really long hair. So, I go to look at new products. yadda yadda (I used to keep it to my knees, now it's at my waist) I love the selection of products. I can't say the prices are inexpensive, however, you are in a beauty store. If you want inexpensive, try Sally's. (Which I love)  \n\nI went to this particular location because I donate my mane to Locks of Love. (This made my fourth or fifth time)  I was pregnant at the time, so this was a while ago. I chose Ulta because they cut your hair for free and send it to LoL for you. Also, it was the closest to my home. Boy, was I in for a surprise. The stylist asked how I wanted my hair. I said I wanted a straight, blunt cut at my bra strap. Easy enough, no? Considering my hair was below my waistline I easily met the 10 inch requirement.  The stylist asked if she could \"layer\" my hair because she thought it would look great. I explained that I had tried layers and hated it. My hair is too thick and does not curl, but isn't straight. So, I politely repeated that I'd rather have a straight, blunt cut right under my bra strap.  Needless to say, she went on about how she was a MASTER stylist and she felt I made the wrong decision. She put my hair in a pony-tail and snipped ABOVE the rubber band. I'm not a stylist or a master of anything, but even I know you cut below the dang band. \n\nWhen she was done with my cut my hair was right under my shoulder. I was mortified. Now, I realize that hair grows back. However, I am not thin so the shorter hair on me does me no favors. I was pissed. I expressed my concern and she said, \"It's still long by average standards.\" I told her I could give a hoot what the average standard was. It was MY hair, not someone else's. And when you go to a \"master stylist\" he/she should be able to take direction with ease.\nWhat really irked me is that only about 10-12 inches were sent to LoL. Another four inches was on the ground that she ruined trying to get my hair straight from cutting above the band. So, she wasted perfectly good hair that could be sitting on some sick child's head. Talk about wanting to kick her teeth in.\n\nThere are a few reasons this place doesn' t get a one star. 1. The rest of the store is great. The associates are kind and helpful. 2. I called in an complained about my hair fiasco. I was compensated with my ulta card being charged up to a six level. (meaning when you use your card you earn pts to redeem at Ulta locations. I think 6 is one of the, if not the highest level you can get) \n\nI went to a different location and got a nice bottle of perfume and a tote on my redemption points. \n\nI will never let that lady TOUCH my hair again for fear I may punch her with my Master fist.

I am an amateur with make-up. I've had good skin all my life& never wore heavy make-up,  just eyeliner and mascara. However, i just turned 25 and wanted a little change so i decided to go to the make-up store . Unfortunately for me i choose ulta instead of Sephora like many ppl had suggested to me. As my first experience in a \"high end\" beauty store it left me with a bad taste in my mouth, to say the customer service was terrible would be an understatement. I was extremely disappointed, frustrated, and most of all i felt discrimination perhaps even racism. I entered the store, and despite there being 3 employees standing around i received no salutation or greeting.  I then looked in the faces of the three employees, their apparent  attitudes did not present a warm, welcoming environment. I still decided to look around  hoping  there is atleast one good apple in the bunch who would be more than willing to help guide my purchase. As i walked aimlessly up and down the aisles probably with the most confused look on my face i began to become more irritated as the minutes went on and help was no where in sight even though there were actually plenty of associates  standing doing absolutely nothing. So i decided to ask the nearest associate for help selecting a shade appropriate for my skin tone and she in no certain terms said she doesn't know what makeup looks good on black people. Basically dismissed me totally by walking off after finishing her spiel. So now I'm back stuck alone walking thru the aisles reading and rereading product labels, sale signs and i suddenly here \"hello beautiful, you've got great skin\". As i turn and look up i see finally the only brown skin associate in the store. She not only greeted me but complimented me, with a smile and cheery tone might i add. Unfortunately for me she was already helping another customer but atleast she took the time to greet me unlike some of her co-workers who weren't even busy. Needless to say after about an hour of browsing i ended up purchasing a few Shea moisture products just cause it was a great deal plus i had a coupon. While checking out i asked how long the deal lasted and the cashier said until the end of the month. Well she lied or is just not well informed or didn't pay attention. I went back the following day to purchase more shea moisture products despite the terrible customer service because a good deal plus coupon is hard to pass on but, when i got to the cash wrap this time the employee said the deal had ended the previous day which is the same day the young lady cashier told me it goes until the end of the month. He didn't apologize for her error basically berated me and told me i should've looked at the sign. Safe to say i won't be going back and i will be calling corporate.", "date": "2015-10-27 20:27:24"}, {"review_id": "D_SGqJPs_UKBrpfJuq0tkw", "user_id": "ABWt6FTzgM2lKrajsxU5Ow", "business_id": "8HDBSCspx4EEKz4SmNXUmQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This review is specifically for the Salon at Ulta in this location (but love the store too).

My cuts were always very well done.\n\nUnfortunately, my last experience there was so horrible I won't be back, Ever!  \n\nI should have seen the signs when I tried making small talk with the hairdresser and found out she recently graduated from school. I just assumed she was talented and that Ulta (due to the price of their haircuts) was very selective in who they hire.\n\nIt seems they are not.  I came in with two photos of a hair cut. One of the back and one of the front, so she could get a good idea of what I wanted.  Essentially it was a sassy short bob cut.  I also told her that I wanted the back to be slightly shorter than the sides (I just like it that way). \n\nWhat she initially gave me was a highly angled bob with what looked like a reverse mohawk up the center of the back of my head. Seriously looked like she'd taken clippers and buzz-cut a strip up the back of my head.\n\nI attempted not to freak the fuck out, and politely asked her to blend it in better, and again showed her the photo of the back.\n\nShe managed to get it to look half-way decent, but I gave up on getting her to really fix it... and headed home to get out my own shears to correct it.\n\nWhen I got home is when I noticed just how bad it was. It wasn't even. One side was significantly longer than other. My bangs which were supposed to be left long, had a 1/2 inch section cut way short.

Went to the salon to change my color from medium reddish brown to bright red. Advised Tara the \"stylist\" that if she couldn't do it she could bleach or highlights. She said she could but was very mistaken. 4 HOURS later I left with medium reddish brown hair except for 3 inch bright orange roots. I said my roots don't match my ends and she said \"yeah they came out lighter than I thought.\" Seriously Ive gotten better customer service at McDonalds. I also got an eyebrow wax where after I was not offered a mirror to check and when I got outside noticed that I had specifically asked her to trim them she did not and I was trimming and plucking the next day. I didn't even want to go back to get my hair fixed at this joke of a salon but my fiancee convinced me the $111.00 I spent should require that I at least look like a normal person so off I went. I had to take a 1/2 day at work because I'm going away on business and I  can't go to work like that so went in for 1/2 a day with a hat on. Get to the salon I tell the very nice salon receptionist my issues and she gets a manager for me. I believe her name is Janet or Janice and she took me right to a salon seat to tell me she can only bring the orange back down to what the rest of my hair is - which is the same exact medium red brown that I arrived with. She says the only way I can get the color I originally requested is with bleaching. But she doesn't have time to do that right then as she has a client and I shouldn't bleach it because it was just colored. I tell her I need it fixed right now and ask if taking it back to the original color is the only thing I can do right now and she says yes. So I tell her I want a refund and that I also want it to include the brow wax since she did a crappy job and it made me break out which no other wax has ever done. So she gives me a refund for $80 something. I had to pay for the cut and blowout though at this point I was so upset at the lack of urgency or compassion for her employee ruining my hair. She should have fixed my hair at least back to the reddish brown and given me a FULL refund. It also would have been nice if she acted like she even remotely cared that the top of my head was florescent orange because her employee doesn't know what she is doing.

So cheap! \"Not so fast, dummy\", I should have told myself. \n\nFirst, I got a shampoo from what seemed like an angry sadist grinding into my head with the shiteous Redken brand. My hair was immediately crunchy. \n\nGot the normal baiting questions from hair salon school 101: Who does your color? You do it yourself? You're damaging your hair, come to me. Hey, Ulta, you seem to have a hard time with a shampoo, color may not be something you want to fool with. She then told me I should add on  a deep conditioner. Now? Yea no shit, you just ripped my hair to shreds with your bottom barrel shampoo.\n\nNext, she brushed my wet curly hair  with a wire round brush  and it frizzed instantly.  She told me my hair would fall out soon if I kept dying it and she couldn't brush through it bc it was colored. No, boo, no. It's snarling bc YOU USE A COMB ON WET HAIR.  Meanwhile I can hear my hair ripping from the brush and my hair is being yanked from my head. \n\nShe complimented herself numerous times, saying how beautiful the blow out was coming. It was frizzing like I had never seen and she never got it straight, something EVERY OTHER STYLIST HAS DONE. \n\nAt the end she put pomade in my bangs so they looked wet and matted to my head, while my ends looked uneven and curly. She left the dryer in one place for so long that the back of my head burned. BURNED! This was her first mention of pain is beauty.  Mom? Is that you?\n\nShe tried to pull out the flat iron and I jumped out of the chair and called it a day. I told her my bangs we full of wax and she said \"it's beautiful\"!\n\nThis took 45 minutes. My friend with spiral curls was done in half the time. I went home and had to wash it twice to get the pomade out. Still not there.  I have a regular hair cut and perfect blow dry with no complaints from the stylist in 25 mins. This was absurd and incompetence at it's best. \n\nOn top of this, I was charged $35. Nothing extra from the reg, but tacked on an extra $10. I could have gone to a real salon! For a wash and blow that ripped my hair and I still have a throbbing scalp. Her response was pain was beauty. Um are you some abusive pageant mom?\n\nShe then told me to come to her to get a better cut. Well now my cut doesn't look right bc the ends are fried. I'm soaking it in coconut oil for the next week. My color is dulled. What is the shit from the Kim Kardashian-like bottle their using? This may fly with 19 year olds, but get some real product and learn how to use it.\n\nAvoid this place at all costs. Run by complete nitwits who would just as well be at CVS. Do not expect them to know anything about skincare, hair. Come on. \n\nBe on the look out for the older woman with half blonde half brunette hair, very Dallas, big hair, who tries to compliment you but has to give you an immediate dig.  Always beware of a stylist who criticizes your hair off the bat, they are either covering for the horrible job they're about to do or trying to get you to buy stuff. I've only had one other hairdresser tell me coloring my own hair will make it fall out and go on to say I have horrible hair. This a dum dum move. At least try to get a tip. They were both the worst hair I've ever had. Anyone who can do hair doesn't have to put down what they're working with or your other stylists. \n\n\nGo downtown.

She had me completely convinced that she understands my hair type and told me she thought a lob was best for me.  I showed her several styles that I liked on my pinterest page but I guess it just wasn't what she had in mind and I obviously don't know what I like. I thought I was getting a lob and ended up with the 'Rachel'. The only good thing is that it's a lot healthier. She also tried to let me leave with my hair looking like a puffball in the front, and I asked her to smooth it out. She then informed me that flat ironing was $10.00 extra, even though I paid for a cut and style (seriously?)  and was already paying $20.00 extra because she said my hair was long. That was frustrating,  but the cherry on top was her trying to convince me that dying my own roots is the worst thing ever, even though I've done it for years and just put my gray roots back to my natural color. Anyway, I was there for almost two hours for a cut and style and left feeling like I had the exact mom cut I didn't want.

I think I said something like 'you wouldn't shove past a wheelchair like that' and she got extremely aggressive and verbally abusive and said \"bitch you need to calm down\". I was calm. I was simply asking that my and my service dog's space be respected. The employee then continued to talk to me about the product as if nothing happened. I told her that I felt unsafe and that I'd like her to call the police. I went up to the desk and she was talking to the manager and I asked the manager to ask the customer to leave because I felt unsafe due to her extremely aggressive behavior and interference with my service dog. I ended up calling the police myself but because the staff had pulled my leg about what they'd do, the customer had left by then and the employees also lied and said nobody saw that when an employee had witnessed it but she was in the salon doing a service and they simply didn't want to interrupt her to tell what had happened to the cops. Now I'm in tears and am really triggered. I have PTSD and Ulta shouldn't allow customers who are verbally abusive and aggressive to the point of making other customers feel unsafe stay at their store. This is the second time they've shown no regard for me having a service dog.

Needless to say, I dropped a lot of change there on beauty goodies.  The sales associate had nicely offered me a Ulta club card, which gives you points towards free products.  I declined, noting that \"there's no Ulta where I live,\" and applied the points to my friend's Ulta card.\n\nAnd guess what opened up right by my beloved Target after I retuned to the east coast?  Ulta, of course!\n\nBecause I was flush with products, I waited a bit before visiting my new local Ulta outpost.  Smart move on my part!  I snagged a 20 percent off coupon from Ulta's Web site and happily restocked my hair products at a discount, including my beloved Devacurl shampoo.  Moreover, the chain recently started selling Stila, and I scored a fantastic set of SIX full-sized products for $40.  The discount didn't apply to high-end cosmetics, but I'm definitely not whining about the price of that set. (Get 'em while they're hot, ladies!)\n\nAfter visiting the colossal Ulta in SoCal, I was impressed that Ulta squeezed itself into the former Pier One.  I'm thrilled to have Ulta in the 'hood.

My first visit was an absolute nightmare. I had called the day before to see if they needed any information from my stylist at my former location. I was told the stylist who would be doing my hair would call beforehand to get my color formula & I would be all set. I gave the information & figured all would be well. Wrong. I had a 6:00pm appointment and after waiting almost 45 minutes, I was finally sitting in the chair. The stylist (I think it was Dawn...I was not impressed, so I didn't make an effort to remember) had not called the salon, had no idea what was going on, and then after another 10 minutes of calling Ulta in Orlando, she came back to tell me they did not have one of the colors needed for my formula. *sigh* She assured me she could still get close to my desired color by using another formula. By this time, I'm pissed off and just want my hair done. I reluctantly agreed and she went to work. After I had spent a total of 4 hours in the salon (my hair isn't even to my shoulders), I was finally finished. Hair color looked decent enough, but I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Fast forward to the next time I needed an appointment. I called and explained what happened the last time, and also explained I need someone fun & fresh. I change my hair color like the wind blows, so I want a stylist who is okay with the fact I might go from redhead to brunette every 12 weeks or so. I was given an appointment with Teresa and WHAT A DIFFERENCE A NEW STYLIST MAKES!!!!!!!! She was so nice and took time to listen to what I wanted. The copper color I had going on was fading too quickly for my liking, so I told her I wanted to go darker. Really dark. She whipped out the swatch book and in no time she helped me pick out a fun, new color! She worked quickly, and efficiently - which was a total turn around from my last appointment there. Teresa was quite personable and I really enjoyed my few hours there! While I'm not 100% impressed with this Ulta in general, I do like Teresa and will continue to go back to her.

I told her about 3 times that I deleted the email and was SURE I didn't have it. EVEN IN MY TRASH. She kept asking me the same question and I kept telling her I DON'T HAVE IT and I don't understand why I'd need to have it because it shouldn't it be on their computer since I bought it with my Ulta rewards card? \n\nThen, she calls over another girl and they both start going through my emails and reading them out loud asking me if it was the right email. I made 3 purchases after the purchase they were looking for and they kept asking if that was the one and I'd have to tell them, AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE THE EMAIL. In the end, I left totally frustrated with my items and the number of Ulta's customer service line.\n\nI wouldn't mind if they didn't have my receipt in their computer or even if they couldn't process a refund to my card but I would have liked for them to at least mention that if I couldn't have gotten a refund to my card, I could get store credit. (Which I found out myself after going through the Ulta return policies online)\n\nVERBATIM: \"Online returns to store without the original email receipt, applicable free gifts and pack slip are only eligible for EXCHANGES or STORE CREDIT.\"\n\nShe didn't explain why I'd need a receipt with pictures or why I'd even need a receipt She didn't explain how I could go about getting the receipt with pictures. She just gave me a number to their customer service phone line, condescendingly went through my emails after I assured her it wasn't there, and acted like I was wasting her time. \n\nThe service at this Ulta is....absurd. You have to hunt down grumpy staff to ask questions they never know the answer to. This store really is of minimum help and maximum frustration and it's a shame because I really wanted to like this store. Is it because I don't dress up when I shop here? Is it because I'm a person of color?

However you better believe when I go out to go out, my face is beat to the gods. \n\nI love all stores that fuel this obsession and Ulta is no exception. I'll break it to you straight, Ulta's rewards program knocks Sephora's out of the water, actually almost everyone's does. However at Ulta the points you collect can be redeemed for actual cash towards a purchase! In addition when you reach platinum level (do you even need to ask if I've reached that level?) you earn more per dollar you spend than the one to one ratio Sephora uses.\n\nThe issues I've had with Ulta mainly stem from their ridiculously slow online shipping but I can't blame this store for that. Other than that all of my Ulta experiences have been great!\n\nThe staff here is friendly but they are slightly understaffed during peak hours; you may have to wait to be helped. About 3-4 times a year Ulta offers 20% coupons off everything, even their prestige brands. This includes Lorac, Smashbox, Too Faced, Bare Minerals, IT Cosmetics (even the brushes!), Urban Decay, and many more. Yes, I said THREE TO FOUR TIMES A YEAR. This totally trumps the recent hot mess of Sephora's annual VIB/Rouge sale. This coupon is given to all members of their rewards program, not just top tier. Plus they always have awesome gifts with your purchases (that's right Sephora, I'm side-eyeing you so hard right now).\n\nIn addition, twice a year they do 21 days of beauty specials which has ridiculous deals on items you probably like and have eyed. Case in point: I picked up the Urban Decay Naked BB cream for $17 during one such event and the Too Faced Sweethearts Blushes for $15 during another. Can Sephora top that? Didn't think so. Why with all of these benefits do I remain loyal to both stores though? Sephora does have more \"designer\" brands and many exclusive releases which keeps them constantly in my rotation. \n\nUlta also carries drugstore brand cosmetics as well as NYX. Their prices are more than fair and every week you can easily get some sort of discount on those brands. They also have a salon and many hair products as well as designer fragrances. I'm loyal to my salon and products so I can't comment, however they have some ridiculously priced deals on Living Proof hair products.\n\nAt the end of the day, the life of a hoarder maximizes where to get their fix. As a result, I shop at both stores because there are things I can buy at either store. If you're a loyal Sephora fan who mainly shops for the aforementioned Prestige Brands, I'd recommend you check Ulta out.

I thought that was strange because I was told she wouldn't be in the salon until 2:30.

When that employee met with me I asked her for the cleanser which she then made some constipated look for and told me she had never heard of such a thing. Then asked me what brand I was looking for. I replied it was the ulta brand and she said she had never heard of it. She walked to a corner of the store looked for about a minute and then said it was out of stock. She directed me to another product that she thought would be similar. She walked away and I quickly looked on their site for the product to see if it said it was in stock at this store as clearly this employee didn't take the time of day to properly look. It was definitely in stock. I wait in line to the cash register and ask for help there, that cashier tells the other cashier to help me. Then that cashier goes and comes back with a ton of the cleansers I was looking for stating they were not shelved. I bought my cleanser without any apology for their shortcomings or waste of time. I seriously dislike this ulta so much.", "date": "2016-08-21 17:04:30"}, {"review_id": "GXnyakO8jGi7RsTT_ojfXg", "user_id": "uRBQnm-0k_M1BxbZiK-MZA", "business_id": "8HDBSCspx4EEKz4SmNXUmQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Sometimes they're out of stock of a lot of things for long periods of time.

I have naturally curly hair that has a mind of its own, and I was beyond tired of fighting with it on  a daily basis and having few styling options and since a relaxer was out, I opted to get the KeraStraight.\n\nI'm a long-time Ulta customer, and I've gotten the treatment (with FANTASTIC results) before, so I was a little worried when the store I'd previously frequented didn't have records of the services I'd received. In hindsight, I realize that I should have  canceled the appointment immediately and done a little more research, but I trusted my previous experience and my stylist, Teanna.\n\nA caveat: Teanna is the stylist who worked on my hair, and she's AWESOME. She's professional, friendly, and wants her clients to be educated about what they're doing to their hair with different services. I just think things went horribly wrong with this particular treatment.\n\nAnyway, after five hours of sitting in the salon, I had smooth, mostly straight hair. I say \"mostly straight\" because Teanna had barely touched my roots, saying that it wasn't advised for her to put much of the product or heat there. I remembered the previous stylist having no qualms about doing it, but said nothing since my hair looked awesome, for the most part.\n\nI sailed through the next week with mostly silky, mostly straight, mostly controlled hair. It was my best hair week in a long, long time. \n\nThen came time to wash it, and that is when I realized that this had not gone well. I wanted to bring out my supposedly defined curls out for a carefree weekend, but was instead met with curls that didn't know whether they were coming or going. Based on my previous experience, I knew that my curls would be looser than normal. That was to be expected. What I didn't expect was curls that refused to curl completely, sections of hair that refused to be anything other than straight, and curls that looked like they hadn't seen the treatment at all. \n\nI currently have multiple curl patterns in my head right now, and I can't go to my quick \"wash and go\" style because of it. \n\nSince I'm not the type to give up, I decided to straighten my hair this morning, and wasn't completely unhappy with how my hair turned out. That lasted until I stepped outside on this humid morning, and felt my style fall flat and my hair frizz up. That didn't happen when I had the treatment previously. I could wear my hair curly because the treatment hadn't interfered with the integrity of my curls. I could straighten it and it would remain frizz free and hold the style, even on heavily humid days. \n\nKeraStraight is supposed to  last for three months, but I don't think mine will last that long. I fully expect my hair to revert back to what it was in about a month.\n\nI'm so beyond disappointed. I realize that it's not a relaxer, and only reduces frizz to a certain point, but I'm not a total newb when it comes to this treatment. It just didn't work out for me, and I'm out of nearly $300 on top of it.\n\nI'm only giving three stars because the service was excellent.

Since I was a new client I got 20% off bringing my total to $101.40. For all my friends who know me I don't normally spend that much money on myself but this was completely worth it. Thanks Cindy!

I also received a conformation text message from Ulta confirming my appointment for THURSDAY AUGUST 24 @ 7:45 PM. The woman at the salon took a walk in appointment thinking she would finish her quickly before I got there and when I showed up ON TIME for my appointment she lied and stated that there was nothing in the system. She then offered to take me AFTER she finished the walk-in (even though I had an appointment). The store closes at 9 PM and she told me that it would be at least 30 mins before she finished her WALK-IN, at which point I told her would you rush on my hair the store closes at 9 and she gave me a look like yeah I would.

Ironically, the shade she came up with was the one I had picked up originally myself.  She quickly explained the contents of the starter kit, but that was the extent of our interaction.  I thought she'd at least ask if I needed help with anything (a good salesperson would have) or see if I had any questions.

Unfortunately the location isn't within walking distance of a T/bus stop (15 - 20 min) which accounts for 1 lost star. There is ample free parking in the plaza though. \n\nMAKEOVER: I was particularly pleased with Jack, she handled herself as a professional makeup artist should and she led me through every step of what she was doing. She was easy to talk to as well, big plus! She asked thorough questions re: my typical makeup style and what colors I was comfortable with which was excellent. I made my appointment for 10am and Karen wasn't in until 11am to do my hair, and Jack kindly offered to wash and condition my hair so we wouldn't get off track for me to leave @ 12pm. \n\nHAIR: Karen rolled in and started on my hair around 11:20. Her technique was a little rough, but she left my hair beautiful, bouncy, and voluminous. The end result was exactly what I wanted, and she was also friendly. \n\nNEGATIVES: the store is just waking up around 10am so we didn't get started with services until nearly 10:20 - 10:30am. Jack had to come and go answering phones etc because the weren't enough associates, I think. The atmosphere is a little cold (retail associates are a little aloof/withdrawn, with accounts for the 2nd lost star), although my services were fine. \n\nVERDICT: due to distance I'm not sure about the likelihood of me coming again, but I wish this Ulta was closer to Boston because I would definitely come again.

Yes, they have a tiny bit less selection of the higher end stuff than Sephora, and a whole half of the store that is basically a glorified CVS, but I still prefer Ulta overall for a few reasons:\n\n1)  SO much cleaner than any Sephora I've ever been to.  Maybe b/c those have always been in malls or downtown, but all of the testers at this Ulta seem impeccably clean, and the store overall has a very clinical look and feel (white walls and floors, lots of light).

When I am actually considering dropping $100 on a blowdryer, I damn well better be able to try that thing out beforehand.  They have all of their dryers plugged in and set up in the display in back so you can try before you buy.  (This might seem silly to some people, but anyone who has naturally curly hair gets me - the rest of you lucky ducks don't need to spend $100 to begin with). \n\n3)  Really great deals from time to time.

I will say that Jessica did a great job on the cut, no complaints there.  As for the color...I asked for a single-process color **as light as you can go without it looking brassy.**  I have olive skin and HATE orange-ish (?) hair color.  I made that clear several times, and asked several times if my request was realistic, and she assured me that it was.  She described the color as \"ash blond.\"  So she did that, and mentioned that they were having a special on highlights, so I took advantage of that to make it even lighter.\n\nAs you can probably guess, it came out orange.  She put a toner on it, still orange.  She added more highlights, still orange.  As she tried more things, she also tried convincing me simultaneously that it was NOT orange, and that it was my fault because she warned me that it might turn orange.  Umm, no, she didn't.\n\nShe then asked me what I wanted her to do--I said, FIX THE ORANGE!!!!!  I am not a hairdresser, I don't know how to fix it!  She truly seemed to not know what to do.  I asked for more toner, but she was afraid it'd turn my hair blue (!).  I have had toner before, and was ok with the risk, but she really didn't seem to want to do it. \n\nThis ordeal took almost four hours.  I left at 2:15, after having been there since 10:30!  \n\nIn fairness, she did a great job on the cut, and did not charge me for any of it, which I felt bad about.  But the color is awful, and any stylist who lies about what you discussed and lies about the fact that she did it wrong (saying it was not orange), is bad news.  She really didn't seem to have a clue how to fix it, and wound up crying while I stood here.

I REALLY did.\n\nI learned about it after purchasing a Groupon for it.  I typically love Mediterranean food and so finding this place that was so close by my house felt like a huge win.\n\nBut, alas, it really let me down.  I had a Groupon ($7 for $15 worth of food) so I ended up ordering the daily special (a lamb plate with salad) as well as a side of tabouli salad and hummus.  Where do I even begin?\n\nI was a bit put off that they wouldn't let me substitute tabouli for the side salad (even when I offered to pay extra) - though I do understand the logic behind the \"no substitutions\" thing.  So instead, I ordered tabouli on the side.  \n\nIt probably took about 10 minutes for my meal to come out (I ordered it to go).  When I got home, starving, I couldn't wait to tear in to the food.  However, it was sort of one train wreck after another.  I started with the tabouli.  It was good, but it was very, very salty.  Not to mention, the container was pre-packed and I watched the guy take it from their \"to go\" refrigerator and place it with my order.  Not to say that it wasn't fresh (perhaps they prepare these every day) but that did turn me off.  How do I know how long those things have been sitting there?\n\nAfter tasting the tabouli, I moved on to the side of hummus I had ordered.  This was a big disappointment.  The hummus had virtually no flavor...not the tahini that I'm used to.  I tried doing a mixture of hummus and tabouli on a piece of warm pita, but even that fell short.  \n\nThen I went to the main dish - the lamb, served on a bed of saffron rice with a side salad.  This was where I realized it was over.  For one, the side salad (which I wasn't interested in to begin with) was pretty sad.  At least two of the tomatoes still had the core/stem attached to them.  To me, this indicated that whoever prepped the salad did a really shoddy job cleaning the veggies.  Really disappointing since the tomatoes were virtually all I wanted off the salad anyways.  In addition, there were about two pieces of crumbled feta (weak!) and a bunch of green lettuce, with not much else.  Ok, so the salad sucked.  I could have let that pass.  But it didn't stop there.\n\nI finally tried the lamb.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good.  It certainly didn't taste as fresh as the lamb I've had elsewhere.  And it had this weird, THICK, garlic sauce sort of messily spattered over it.  It was decent, but it wasn't good.  The thickness of the sauce sort of threw me off...as if it had sort of thickened over time (i.e. been left over for too long).  The rice that the lamb was served over was hardly edible....it tasted like it had come out of a microwaveable package - it was chewy and bland.  \n\nOverall, this meal was just a real disappointment.  Like I said, I really WANTED to like this place.  And the owner (I think that's who he was at the register) seemed super friendly and nice.  To their credit, the place was full (it was peak lunch time, but still) and there seemed to be a lot of \"regulars\" there (most likely people who work in the area).  But I just wasn't impressed...at all.  It was even worse that I ended up having to pay an extra $2.50, on top of the Groupon value, for the meal.\n\nIf you want really good, authentic, tasty Mediterranean fare at a great price, go to Hush Hush cafe.  \n\nGood luck.", "date": "2010-06-15 02:02:43"}, {"review_id": "QiP8lfdaZtMGzbM_c29biQ", "user_id": "BW1x1sGwwzvhjpikkvhSKg", "business_id": "8HDBSCspx4EEKz4SmNXUmQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Ulta is a god send for most women...especially those who love make-up accessories, perfume, and all that other girly stuff.

We used to frequent Ulta at least once a month as a treat and to de-stress.\n\nGoing to Ulta used to be a wonderful experience, and this trip was initially no exception. We even met one of the best greeters! She was genuine and jubilant. However, when we went to check out, we encountered a cashier, Amanda. When we told her that we did not want to sign up for the reward program, she proceeded to exclaim \"WHY NOT?\" You could hear her condescension clearly, as if she were trying to shame us into signing up. She treated my daughter like a child and repeatedly put her down in front of the other customers and staff. Some of the other shoppers even laughed. When finishing the sale, Amanda added, \"I'll put this brochure in your bag so you can see all these things you are missing out on.\" She then proceeded to treat me with the same level of derision. When I asked to speak with the manager, her demeanor changed to one of an innocent employee. It soon became clear that she was part of the management team, but she was not forthcoming about the fact that she, herself, had a manager in the store. I only found out when I called to follow-up and spoke to Amanda's manger, Taylor.\n\nThere is a difference between enthusiastically pushing a service and publically, and loudly, mistreating a customer in order to push a program. Looking at the reviews for this store, it seems that poor customer service is not taken seriously.\n\nIf you are looking for a place to have a good time, it is not at this Ulta. Frankly, it reflects poorly on the company of a whole if the management team perpetuates such conduct.

It's definitely the worst salon experience I've ever had. I booked an appointment to get a haircut, cover my grays, and do highlights. In every other salon I've been to, this process took at most 3 hours. I was in this salon for 5 whole hours and the results were absolutely terrible. She only partly did my haircut and then started the highlights, which I've never had anyone else do. Not to mention, she did the highlights before touching up my grays. I was afraid that if she did the root touch-up after highlights, this would totally get rid of the highlights. She assured me this wouldn't happen, but it definitely did. She also rushed through doing the foils on one side of my head and on the top. I expressed concerns over the uneven highlights, and she promised the highlights would be evened out after putting on toner after doing my roots. I objected to the use of a toner because I had another experience where it completely darkened my highlights and I liked the color they had reached. Again, she made many assurances that this would not happen. She then did my roots sloppily, and I still have a huge amount of grays. At that point my highlights were gone. At the end, she finished doing rest of my haircut, and it ended up being the worst haircut I've received in years. It lacked everything I had asked for and was the cherry on top to the most horrible salon experience I've ever had. Let me emphasize that this was after 5 entire hours.

This review sounds fairly negative, and it's hard for me reconcile why I like this place so much when it's hard to give their food a good review. Sometimes, things are like that. I just like them and I will continue to visit here. I hope they see areas they can improve and do so as I know they're fully capable of it. \n\nThe espresso isn't perfect, but it serves it's purpose. Their Turkish coffee is delicious! I heart cardamom.\nThe service is usually very friendly and they will start recognizing you after a few visits. They always address their regulars by name and ask how you're doing. \n\nFood: All over the place. They have the potential to really step this up, but linger somewhere between a coffee-bar plus and a quick lunch spot. I would not recommend coming here for a sit-down meal, it's not that kind of place, though I think they would like to be. If you're vegetarian or vegan, there are a lot of options.\n\nTheir burger is huge and decent for the price, though not spectacular. It comes with previously-frozen french fries which are usually crispy and good, though a coworker noted she got moldy fries once. She didn't notice until she got back to work, but I have no doubt if she had mentioned it to the staff, they would have rectified it right away.\n\nThe various Lebanese dips are hit-and-miss. I really love baba ganoush, so I wish theirs was better. Mostly, it's bitter/lemon and garlic which predominate instead of smokey eggplant goodness. Sometimes, it's delicious. The stuffed grape leaves are pasty. They grill pita bread to give you with the dips, though once I was told bread didn't come with the baba (though it has every other time).\n\nThe lamb plate had slices of gyro/doner/shawarma over iceburg lettuce and a side of yellow rice. The garlic/tzatziki-like dressing on the lettuce was strong and delicious. There were chunks of tomato, feta, and onion. The rice was plump and moist, but not very flavorful. The meat slices were okay, but a bit dried out and salty.

I was also accused of lying and told that I was aware of the price before she cut my hair and that they watched the cameras.

I am not one to bad mouth or write a horrible review but since this happened to my 13 year old I felt compelled as a mother.\n\nWe went in around 5:30 for both my 11 and 13 year old to get trims. The minute Diane took our information in the computer I knew it was going to be a problem. She was cracking random jokes trying to be silly with the kids. She asked my youngest what her name was and had a sigh of releif because her name wasn't spelled with extra letters in it like some of the name out there today. How rude!!! She was complaining about the computer software and seemed annoyed. It was funny for all about 2 minutes, then I started to get concerned that this whack job would cut their hair. She said the kids were the last cuts of her day. Her jokes were just uncalled for.\n\nShe took my oldest back to the chair to look at her hair. She took it out of her top knot and let her hair down. THE MINUTE my daughter let her hair down- started the condescending almost insulting comments. Now my daughter are biracial and my 13 year old has long curly course hair. Dianes facial expressions and remarks were shaming. She asked when the last time her cut was and what she wanted to do. She asked if she wore it down or in THAT bun on her head all the time.\n\nMy oldest wanted long layers but wanted to keep it long. She wears it down and curled to school. Diane offered to do a \"Diva Cut\". For me I am not familiar to the hair stylist lingo so I asked, what's that?. SHE TOLD ME TO LOOK IT UP ON MY PHONE. I think I was stunned and she definitely seen my reaction, she said, oh no, I'm not trying to be rude but I can't really explain it to you. YOU CANT EXPLAIN IT TO ME??? How is this supposed to make the client feel comforted. I was worried. We went back and forth with what my daughter wanted and I felt unsettled even still. She took her over to the sink to wash and came back to the chair.\n\nShe sits down and throws the towel at the mirror and says, I'm pissed right now! I look at my daughters brand new Nike sweatshirt and there is RED HAIR DYE ALL OVER THE BACK AND ON HER NECK. I said what is that? She said, my coworker did a color and didn't clean the sink! I was about to LOSE IT.\n\nI ask to speak to the manager- She said I am the salon manager-( JUST MY LUCK!!!) I said okay, Where is YOUR manager. She said my general manager Jessica is here.\n\nI wait 5 minutes for Jessica. During that time, Diane is saying things like, This is a free haircut, There is a stain remover you can buy at Target, etc. The \naudacity!\n\nJessica come over and from the look on her face, this may have not been the first time something like this has happened. She DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE PROPER COMPASSION. Just turns away, walking towards the office saying, I'll be right back I need to make sure I handle this properly with all the facts. For a minute I thought by the general manager coming over that I would feel better about things but no.\n\nShe comes back out and says, I will print you out an in store claim and corporate will handle it. I said, Handle it? What does that mean. She said whether to dry clean or not.\n\nShe barely even walked over to look at my child's damaged shirt! I took pictures and told my daughter to get up and we are leaving. Sadly there will be no hair cut today. \n\nDiane snarled and said, you know I'm a good hair stylist right? As she is brushing my daughters soaking wet hair. I said I am sure you are but this didn't start the way it should have. \n\nShe then said you know I felt attacked by you. WHATTT? I said, I am sorry you felt that way but you are ultra unprofessional and had NO EXPLANATION to the type of cut for my daughter, do you expect me to agree with whatever you are saying then have something go wrong and my child hate her hair cut? I am making the call and we are leaving.\n\nIt's not even about the stained sweatshirt. That's material things. It's about the way we felt and the lack of professionalism. We felt very uncomfortable. I shop there regularly and spend a lot of money on makeup and products for my family. We should have had a easy going conversation about it. It just seemed like it was the end of her day and was too big of job to deal with. Who knows?!\n\nI expect corporate to follow up with me and handle proper compensation. They just lost two hair cut sales today.  I will not be shopping at the Everett location anymore.\n\nMy girls thanked me in the car after we left and were proud of the way I handled it. Never stoop to the level of ignorant people. I really feel like she thought my daughters texture of her hair was repulsive and an annoyance to her. She clearly didn't know what to do with it clearly. She didn't make my daughter feel comfortable, beautiful or confident. I am always going to be an advocate for my child. Speak up when things don't feel right.

I wandered around for about 10 minutes checking out all the lovely things.  Two sales people looked me up and down and said nothing to me.  I picked up different products, tried some testers, and still no contact.  I observed they were chatty with others, mostly teenage ladies with their moms.

They chose to chat with each other, and cast an occasion look around to smile at others and offer assistance here and there. \n\nI found what I wanted to purchase and headed to the register.  I stood alone in the queue waiting for the stylist to finish her conversation with the cashier.  They both looked at me several times as I waited.  They talked and talked. It was around 7pm and the stylist was complaining about something earlier and told the cashier she had to clean up.  She assured her everything was all set and she wanted to leave.

I don't normally feel so uncomfortable at these stores.  I would have hoped the staff would have been more friendly and helpful, like the other Ulta locations usually are.

I called customer service within 1 minute, sat on hold for 28 minutes to make sure I correct the shipping address to match my current billing address.

I called them instantly explaining my situation that I don't live in California anymore and all they said to me was that I need to update my address book online. Seriously?! Backstory- 2 weeks earlier I placed over $250 in purchases online for my favorite things party gifts and that was shipped to my correct address.

The section where this brand was located was maybe 15 feet away from the cash register, so she looks at me and doesn't say anything but rolls her eyes and walks over to the Colorpop section.

Every dog Indigo takes has multiple issues, some medical, some behavioral, and require lengthy rehabilitation and very SPECIFIC homes! Just because you think a dog looks cute or you think you want a dog does not mean that you are the appropriate home for that particular dog.\n\nI encourage you to look up Indigo Rescues 990 tax returns, which is public record, and to call Washington County Animal Services (Bonny L. Hays) or Multnomah County Animal Services and ask about Indigo's 15 year committment to unadoptable dogs! Indigo does not take dogs that are easy to \"flip\" as some other rescue do. \n\nHeather not only runs every aspect of the rescue, she goes out to rescue animals that are lost or in dangerous situations, so sometimes she can't answer an email or application right away, but I guarantee you if you are an appropriate match for a dog, you will hear from her! \n\nIndigo Rescue is the last chance, the end of the line for difficult dogs. Heather took in 2 blind tightly bonded brothers and chose to keep them together. Those dogs were fostered for 4 years until she found the most wonderful home that was appropriate for them. Not many people want 2 85lb blind brothers. Heather has also placed dogs that have been raped by their owners, dogs that have been hung from trees and dogs with extreme surgical needs. She works tirelessly, 7 days a week, so the complaining about \"Heather didn't call me back\" is just petty. Tearing down someone who is doing such good work in my opinion is really unconscionable. \n\nHeather wouldn't respond to these negative comments because it would take time away from her work, placing 1000's of challenging dogs speaks for itself, because after all it's about saving lives!", "date": "2015-06-03 05:26:20"}, {"review_id": "lBtREmzwm5f28fkeCdhIXA", "user_id": "OQ8pvKQszxy5GHGPJ1Ndrg", "business_id": "8HDBSCspx4EEKz4SmNXUmQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I made an appointment for hair treatment and I asked the lady on the phone if I there is any instructions that I should follow, she asked me to wait for a moment, while she asks someone, then she told me that there are no instructions or anything that I should do.

Wow what a change from the old mixed use neighborhood of light industrial and neighborhoods of charming old small Victorian houses and brick apartment houses from the turn of the last century.  So long story short, I was bored (and thinking \"why do I always do this?\")and decided to explore this new neighborhood and see what I could \"scare up.\"\n\nJust a couple of blocks down and over from my workplace, I found The Sultan Cafe in what I would call a a quite nice strip mall probably built in the 1980s.  There are a couple of other small businesses which if I remember are a pet supply store and a veterinarian, but please don't quote me.  This review is a little late to the Yelp party by a couple of months.\n\nThe Sultan Cafe sits up probably no more than a few stairs from street level.  It seems to me a bit difficult in terms of accessibility both in side and outside.  There are plenty of rails as one climbs the few stairsto hang on too for those with bad knees, and again inside and outside the space is narrow for those with crutches and wheelchairs.  Surprisingly street parking is not too bad here, but soon enough it will get difficult as new housing is being built all over on this side of town; building cranes dot the Portland landscape, due to our housing hortage.  I saw no nearby parking garages.\n\nThe restaurant itself is smallish but cozy.  There are a couple of areas with low-slung couches available for hookah smoking.  Closer to the cash register and food service area, there are regular chairs and tables.  I did not use the restrooms, but I would have to say that as the rest of the space is super clean, the restrooms would be the same.\n\nThe menu tends toward Mediterranean and Middlre Eastern andwiches, soups, and salads.  Other reviewers have raved about their lamb gyros and this is a great thing to know and would likely bring me back for lunch.  They also sell a variety of cold drinks from the refrigerarator case and also sell really excellent coffee and coffee drinks and tea  the dessert menu was tempting. Service from the gentleman was quick, accurate, and friendly.  It struck me he was probably the owner.\n\nBesides my coffee drink, I ordered a wonderful and quite large chese bagel with cream cheese that hit this early bird's breakfast spot.  I thought prices were in keeping with this area of town and still quite reasonable.  Customers order at the counter and also pick up there.\n\nI think this is a wonderfully warm and welcoming neighborhood hang-out spot.

I had an appointment for a perm with Jonathan. Now I have previously colored my hair, so I asked my stylist to look at my hair and see if he thought it could handle the damage.

Before applying the neutralizer, though, she took all of the perm rods out. Which unfortunately meant that my hair was left straight. My main stylist offered me a free haircut as compensation, in addition to not charging me for the perm. He cut off maybe an inch of my hair. However, when I washed my hair today is now very apparent that about 95% of it is now chemically fried and unsalvageable. The only option I have will be to completely shave my head. I was never apologized to by Leah or any member of management. Jonathan told me to come back in three weeks to try the perm again. There is absolutely no way my hair will be able to handle that, seeing as it is completely gummy and straw-like. He had to have known how damaged my hair was while he was cutting and blow drying it. Clearly my hair was not in good enough condition to be permed in the first place, and he should have known that.

We got a reply with in a few days and had a meet and greet the next week. \nOriginally we were looking at a different dog from the litter but after talking with Heather she told us about another pup who would fit our family better and she was right! He's perfect for us!\nI felt that Heather the owner did ask a lot of questions but this was good! She also gave us a lot of advise. On the day of the meet and greet we got to meet the foster mom who is a wonderful human! I felt this was a great thing to do, who knows the dog better then the foster? I have two young children who came with and fell in love almost immediately! They encouraged us to bring our 3 year old pup with us too! They wanted to make sure this adoption was a great fit for EVERYONE. We placed our application and were approved within a few days. \nOver all working with Indigo was an amazing experience and I would do it all over again. They were very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions promptly. The foster even provided us with a puppy pack of all of his favorite toys and treats. On the day of adoption both Heather and the foster came to our home to help with the transition. They stayed for about 30-45 minutes while my 3 year old and the new puppy played and got adjusted to one another. I was very impressed by this! They cared about him so much to drive out to our house and help him get settled in! \nI am still in contact with both the rescue and the foster as they are interested in seeing him grow up and hearing how he is doing. I know they have the dogs at heart here! The foster mom even cried when she was leaving him at our home the day of adoption. They truly love and care for these dogs!\nFor anyone who is reading reviews and trying to decided if they should work with indigo I want to encourage you to reach out and see what you think.

Regarding our expertise, we have worked with most cities, counties, states and federal agencies for over 11 yrs and successfully helped hundreds of organizations across the USA.  Without client involvement to interview, consult and gather information it is impossible to get the work done.   \nI agree that $1,398 is a lot of money,  however,  our top competitors charge several thousand dollars for the 8a only and you were offered 3 certifications for the price of two, a lot less money than any of our competitors.   After checking with my team it seems you were upset that the document review \"binder\" option was not included ($199 Extra) and that is what lead to you post a negative review on our service.\nI was surprised to hear that after months of posting this review you are now coming back to us again for help.  While I wish you would have contacted management before going online, I am still willing to help you prepare the certification applications and review all supporting documents in the checklist. However please note;  it has been months since our initial work has been completed and we will have to recreate the applications again along with reviewing your supporting documents ( 6-10 hours of extra work).  I will not ask for any additional money to re-prepare certification applications or binder, however future support may be billed hourly if desired.\nAlso, I do feel it is fair to ask for an online retraction from your Yelp review, which is not accurate. The review forms a negative opinion about our certification service, which hurts our businesses.  I will call you to discuss this in the hopes that we can resolve this matter positively.\nThank you.\nEfrain Read less\n\n\nIn response to the vendor's reply....\n\nI did contact the team by email prior to posting my review and my team called the initial sales person. Your team's response was that I would have to purchase another product offering. I have the email if you didn't receive it.\n\nPlease note that we never requested a special price nor did we receive a special price. If your team could not provide the requested service for the quoted price, then you should have not quoted the price. Hopefully, your competitor's price is more because they provide a better deliverable.

The email was sent to Heather who I believe runs the rescue and happened to be the dog's adoption counselor. I did not hear back from anyone for 2 days so I called the rescue and left a message. The next day I finally received an email response stating that they would contact the foster mom to work out a time to meet the dog. A week went by and I heard nothing so I sent another email inquiring if the dog was still available. It has been 3 weeks and I still have not received a response.\n\nI understand that they are busy but I find their lack of communication and disregard for my time to be down right rude. If they are too busy to get back to people in a reasonable amount of time they should let you know that it will take a few weeks. If they thought I wasn't a good fit for the dog a quick email communicating that would have been nice and they even could've suggested another dog that better fits my lifestyle. It would have been nice to hear something instead of being blown off.\n\nIts not really fair to the animals because by leaving people hanging they are missing opportunities to put animals in homes that could potentially be a great place for them. If Indigo Rescue's goals are to adopt out spayed/neutered pets instead of having people buy from breeders they should really consider how their actions could drive people away from wanting to adopt. I ended up adopting 2 dogs from Family Dogs New Life and I HIGHLY recommend them. They were upfront and honest. They did not waste my time like Indigo Rescue and they also provided me with lots of information and resources for being a responsible pet owner.", "date": "2012-07-02 03:42:46"}, {"review_id": "7zLRUcUsONDF8-jO6tbb3w", "user_id": "FIPz-D_qsOT3TuNhGn9n3g", "business_id": "PlUQoPQTCtXeZ7Q9DsIynA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Everyone was safe with their masks and enforced that rule.

Brianna looked up without a smile or greeting, asked me if I wanted some water, and told me to go sit over there in a chair while she grabbed a smock. \n When she came over, she asked me what we would be doing that day. I pulled out my phone to show her two photos of styles my previous stylist had done that I loved. At that point she held my hair out with two fingers and a look of disgust and asked me what had happened to my hair? I asked what she was referring to as I had no idea there were any issues with my hair. To which she responded, again with a sneer, \" I mean what happened to your hair, you have no hair here! Is this just how it grows?\", I mean I guess my hair is thin and doesn't automatically grow in thick and long.\n  I would have got up and left immediately, but I was too dumbfounded. I can't imagine sitting down in that chair with a health condition or other issue that causes hair loss or thinning, I would think any stylist would know how to appropriately respond in a professional and kind manner. I stated that my previous stylist had indicated it was new growth, which would make sense as I had also recently been taking biotin. \n She essentially told me she could \"attempt\" to do what I wanted, but it would just look all stringy and streaky.

What a horrible experience! I will never go back to this salon and after you read this, I hope you understand why.\n\nI had gotten a really cute haircut at the Ulta at The Shops at Tanforan in California during my holiday trip home. Seriously, cute! It was an asymetrical bob and I loved it. Shortly afterwards, I found out that I was pregnant! Yay, but no energy to mess with an actual hair style, so I let it grow out. After a few months, it just looked uneven and I was constantly wearing it up. Along with pregnancy headaches, this was becoming a pain. So, I thought that I would treat myself to a haircut, something basic, not too short, and that I could pull back. (Even though I was tired of wearing it up, I wasn't ready to step completely away from my comfort zone!) I decided that since my experience at Ulta in CA was so positive, I would give this salon a try! I've spent paychecks on makeup there anyway, why not? Wrong.\n\nI got an appointment with Grady. Holy crap, he was terrible. I went in and checked in (he happened to be the person checking me in) and I told him that I didn't remember the name of the person that I had the appointment with because \"it was a quick conversation\" (my exact words, not that funny). He stopped and fake laughed like I just told him the best joke in the world. It was weird, I just got a really strange vibe from him. Then he told me that my appointment was with him. I had a bad feeling already, but off I went. Well, off I went after he told me that he had to finish sweeping. \n\nSo I get to his chair and explain my hair, what I have, and what I want. Since my hair was asymetrical, I asked that we don't go any shorter than the shorter side. He sounded like he got it, and even said that we would use that short side as a guideline. I went in with clean hair so he didn't give me a shampoo, which is fine, but he said that he wanted to blow dry my hair to see what he was working with. Ok. He then proceeded to blow dry for at least a half hour! With a round brush and it was starting to pull my hair! By the time that he started cutting, it was about an hour after my appointment time! That much BS and blow drying?? I just wanted a basic cut. Again, I had a bad feeling.\n\nHe began to cut my very dry hair. And he cut, and cut, and cut. I was getting worried but he actually kinda reassured me that, and I quote, \"I know it seems like I keep cutting but...\" there was nothing after the 'but', he just drifted off. He then stopped to, guess what, blow dry my hair some more! It was dry when I walked in! Now remember that I'm pregnant, and heat is not going to be my friend. I had to tell him to stop and let me have some water because I was way too hot! I hadn't seen or felt the back. He went on with the cut, and he said that he was doing the final cut. The final cut ended up being the side that was the 'short' side, you know, the guideline side. Why was he cutting that shorter?? \n\nLet me also mention that during my cut, he stopped to give bad parenting advice to another client next to us after hearing a story about her daughter getting some of her hair cut by a friend. I mean he got personal! I was feeling awkward, the other stylist had walked away and the client just looked really annoyed. They need to drug test this guy, he was so out there! His name is Grady, remember that.\n\nNow he's \"done\" and I reach back and feel the bottom of my hair and it's gone. So short. I was shocked and I started crying! Actually crying! Then I looked at the rest and it was an ugly,  UNEVEN a-line, bob! I never asked for anything like that at all and I definitely did not want it that short! He went and got another stylist and I told her what I had asked for, and I even asked him why he went so short and why he even cut the 'guideline' side and he said, \"I only cut a little bit on that side\". REALLY? Because I asked him not to cut it at all! I couldn't even look at him. It was such an ugly cut that I wondered what self respecting stylist would ever let their client walk out looking like that???\n\nThey got the store manager to call the salon manager, who wasn't there at the time. She said that she would comp the cut and see me on Monday so that she could fix it for me. I was so pissed off at that guy. Grady. Jerk. \n\nNatalie, the salon manager saw me on Monday, layered my hair and said that she would take care of any cuts for the next 3 months or so, without charge. Sounds good, right? Not to me because the experience with that guy makes me never want to go there again. Hell, I may never buy makeup there again! That person really ruined it for me! \n\nSo please take this as a warning! If you do make an appointment at Ulta in Gateway, and they book you with Grady, DO NOT GO TO HIM!!!", "date": "2013-05-13 19:30:57"}, {"review_id": "21mQQd3aL_0e1PeI7yHrOg", "user_id": "ByqS5PCRCgRGJYMh8bwsYw", "business_id": "PlUQoPQTCtXeZ7Q9DsIynA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Nicolas was AMAZING!!!

She also commented on my wife's wedding ring. Normally this could be seen as a normal thing but in this circumstance I believe she was phishing.

When I received the bill my wife called to dispute the additional charge and was met with a very rude person, who was very \"matter of fact\".

I just love to dig my nails into metal zippers and pry open key chains with the very tip of my super short nails.) But when I perform quick mental calculations, I arrive at the conclusion that a bottle or even two of \"salon-quality\" polish is probably cheaper than a mani/pedi and will yield many layers for a half or third as many occasions (taking into account that I usually paint on 2-3 layers, depending on the color). This is a score for me. Oh yes, I will add that I am partial to brands like OPI, Essie, Seche, and Orly because my hairdresser mother prefers these brands. I have yet to move into the arena of Deborah Lippman and truthfully, probably never will.

The chairs to get your hair washed in hurt my neck so badly that it was BRUISED the next day. She washed the dye out with freezing cold water and missed a spot on the back. She gossiped with another co-worker while washing out my hair. During my cut, she took a call for an appointment and then proceeded to trash talk the woman she just got off the phone with. My hair cut was awful. I had split ends almost a week after getting it done and had to have my boyfriend cut the back for me at home- that's how bad it was.

I initially thought it was an isolated incident on my first Ulta visit looking for a specific Loreal deep conditioner product and was quickly \"helped\" by a salesperson in locating the product only to find myself ushered to a super expensive brand the salesperson was pushing promising the same effect (for 10x more than the Loreal version).  When I politely refused, she disappeared and never brought me to the Loreal section.  Despite that experience, I visited again to refill my Bare Escentuals foundation and was pushed to look at some other \"mineral\" product.  My last visit really sealed the deal for me as the salesperson was just relentless despite my polite acknowledgement that I would look at the product she recommended to me (that I never asked for help, opinion, etc).  She continued to push the product and brought me a tester and would not go away until I took the tester in hand.  It was one of the most aggressive sales experiences I have to say I've had.

I told her I just wanted the store credit, but she kept telling me that they wouldn't normally do the return at all. When I told her that the return policy clearly says they accept returns after 60 days for store credit, she just kept saying they wouldn't do it because it isn't in their system. The whole time she spoke to me she acted annoyed like I was completely in the wrong & I should have known better.

NOTHING is Turkish about it. Sorry for the all-caps, but as I'm sure one would understand, I get a little defensive about my hometown food always being called Greek and Turkish. I asked the owner why he had Turkish on it, and he kind of shrugged (I think it's because if he simply had \"Lebanese\" on the sign people wouldn't know what it was, haha.)\n\nThis is my go-to place for a taste of home, it's the best I've found thus far in the ATL. I never get the buffet, I always order from the menu.\n\nTry the fried kibbey. It's amazing. Kibbeh is a type of ground beef that comes in many shapes and varieties, and the type they make is hard to get right.\n\nThe rice is great. Kafta is great. And thank God, the tabboule is not half bulgar wheat. Another lesson in Lebanese food: tabboule should not have bulgar wheat at all (or very, very little.)\n\nThe desset buffet with all the fruits is also very typical in Lebanon- if you were to eat in Beirut, after the 3-hour dinner they clear the tables and spread out a ton of produce and ba-lewa (not baklava- that's Greek). So, it's nice that Sultan's sort of captures that in spirit, and their moist, delicious orange cake is to die for.\n\nThe owner is a really nice Lebanese guy, and try an Almaza beer if they have them in stock.\n\nSa7tain!", "date": "2011-08-11 19:15:46"}, {"review_id": "07wSRHe9WeLpCSwTxDvAhg", "user_id": "a4cUWhGUbAj8o2cLZq89hg", "business_id": "7p6pIV2NkXSvLKdmzx7ZLw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Lebanese and Turkish if your not familiar with the food try going for the buffet lunch and introduce yourself to some new flavors .\n \nTo start Lentil soup , mild in flavor with celery  the lentils held there shape .\nSeveral cold salads including : Cabbage slaw with herbs , Pickled veggies., Tomato and cucumbers , Chickpea salad , Feta and a Greek salad of sorts ,  Hummus and fried cauliflower .

I don't use this hospital or its physicians for any other aspect of my health or medical needs...\nI almost rated this practice with 1 star, but I became pregnant with my son a few years ago, from this same practice, with very little difficulty -- which actually may be more of a reflection of my own abilities, and not the fertility clinic staff's!  :)\nAnyway, I have been trying for pregnancy #2 for almost 10 months with the help of this practice.  Having made many more trips and appointments this time around, I can definitely agree with the other reviewers about how frustrating it is to deal with different physicians at different \"key times\" during treatment.  And the place *is* run like a puppy mill, come to think of it.\nWhile one doctor knows about your history, response to medication, the typical timing of your cycles, etc., the doctor who answers your email or other inquiry seems not to; then, decisions are often based on protocol vs. common sense / past experience.  Doesn't sound too bad, but when large of sums of money are forked over, in vain (not to mention time for appointments, time off work, countless instances where your hopes are dashed, and being 10 months closer to the age of 40!), it's bad.\nOne of the worst parts is the annoying medical assistant who is the gatekeeper to a lot of the communication & planning involved -- that can really diminish patients' confidence and satisfaction.  One in particular, Melisa, would recap the plan for me (or was it for herself??), rattling off incorrect information (dates, medication dosages, wrong donor # for the semen I would be using).  When I would correct her mistakes, she'd say, \"Ya that's what I said.\"  Uh, no it wasn't, and I know this call is being monitored for quality & training purposes, so lets not even contemplate what you said.\nAs a person who only needed donor sperm and IUI -- pretty low-tech, low-profit (?) items off the menu -- I definitely felt low-priority.  I was often seen for appointments long after I'd checked in, right on time.  Once, I told the medical assistant that I had to be back to pick up my son from preschool at 11:45 sharp, so would that 11am appointment really be appropriate for me?  I was assured that it'd be just fine.  I got there at 10:50, was taken back to an ultrasound room at 11:25, waited for over half an hour, had my 2 minute ultrasound + 2 minute Q&A session with the doctor, and then was on my way.  Late to pick my son up, of course.  I know that with IVF, the timing is crucial and the procedures are probably tedious.  But it still doesn't seem fair.  I'm out thousands & thousands of dollars, just like everybody else.  ;)\nI have an appt. with Oregon Reproductive Medicine next week and I'm very optimistic.  May even review them, too!\nI will say that I was almost always able to deal with everything under one roof -- blood work, Pap smear, and RXs.

Yes, I'm a woman, but as one with very fine blonde hair, there's not much you can do with my hair, and it's pretty hard to mess up.\n\nWell, hats off to ULTA because they found a way to mess up my hair.\n\nI needed my hair cut, and I needed to get a new license to go with the new name (marriage and all), so I figured hey! I'll splurge on the haircut so I'll have fabulous looking hair for my license!\n\nWhat a mistake. First of all, the way this place is designed, to me it feels like the salon was an afterthought. All they have are some lame cloth partitions that separate the salon area from the (huge) store. This bothers me mostly because people would come over while I was getting my hair cut and ask the stylist where things are, and want her to show them. Um, I don't know if you noticed, but SHE'S CUTTING MY HAIR. YOU GO NOW.\n\nSecondly, when I get there, there are a bunch of stylists sitting around. I go, and someone asks me what I want, and I say I have an appointment at 11:30. This stylist is in the middle of doing someone else's hair, but tells me she'll be with me in 5 minutes. Well, okay. 5 minutes later she's not done with the other person's hair, but starts consulting with me as to what I want. I told her I wanted my hair chin length and that otherwise, I wanted something different. She asked me if I wanted a bob. I told her NO. She asked me if I wanted layers. I again told her no, that my hair looks silly with layers since it's so fine.\n\nSo, she takes me back to get my hair shampooed and such, and then for some reason, in the middle of applying conditioner to my hair, she just stops and leaves. I sit there for 5 minutes, wondering what in the world is going on. She comes back, and almost looks at me like she expected me to finish for her. Uh what? So she finishes up, and brings me back out. She then leaves me sitting at the chair, with my hair dripping down my back, for 10 minutes.\n\nFinally she comes back and cuts my hair. I can't really see what she's doing, so you can imagine my surprise when she finishes up and I discover she not only did not cut my hair to the length I requested, but gave me layers and basically a bob. What the f. Oh, and she put curls in my hair? I looked like a 50 year old soccer mom. I'm f***ing 25! Why the f*** would I want to look like  fucking soccer mom?\n\nI was basically so flabberghasted I just basically said wow, went up, paid and left. I didn't know what to say. My husband keeps telling me it's not that bad, but I hate this haircut. Now I can't even decide if I should go get my license done because my hair looks ridiculous.

As a result, she wasn't gaining any weight, after having already lost 10% of her body weight in the hospital.

We requested the 4 hour beginner breast feeding consult, spread over 2 sessions. Once Sharon arrived, it took her all of 1 hour to not only ask us all the questions, and make all the observations she needed to properly assess what needed to be done, but she had our baby latching properly within that same hour! She then continued to show us numerous different techniques to help get our baby to latch properly based on the many different circumstances you can endure with a newborn. Such as them being fussy, gassy, tired, etc. She was incredibly thorough in everything she did with us, and noted all of her observations/techniques down for us so we had them moving forward. She also strongly urged us to stay in touch with her as regularly as we wanted, and to not hesitate to call her on her cell if we ever needed anything.

In fact I wouldn't have known it was garlic if he hadn't told us.  \n\nWe started with appetizers.  We got the mezza plate. A combo of tasty but overcooked falafel balls, babaganoush, hummas and tabouleh. This was all pretty tasty to my untrained New England palate.  However, I wouldn't know what it was supposed to taste like if I wasn't told.  \nAt one point during our ordering my wife asked the waiter if they have any garlic. He told her \"yes\", as he looked bewildered and a little confused.  She then told him to \"PUT SOME IN HER FOOD\". (She actually spoke in all CAPS).\n\nOn to the entrees. I had the #5 plate. Chicken kabob,  kufte kabob (it's like a long meatball on a stick), rice, hummus and a tasty roasted tomato. I dove right in. It was nicely presented on the plate. I thought the meat and chicken were cooked just right, not dry. We had two little bowls of sauces. One was a hummus sauce I think and the other was a \"garlic\" sauce. Not the same \"garlic\" sauce we got with the bread earlier. This looked like finely minced garlic suspended in an oil base. It worked ok on the meat. Again the garlic was not overwhelming. I wouldn't worry if you were going to kiss anybody. I cleaned my plate, but then again I usually do.\n\nMy wife wanted to try dessert. She ordered something called Kunefe. She has been looking for a restaurant that has this on the menu, so when the waitress told her that they had it she got excited but skeptical. After about a 10 minute wait we were presented with a rather large slice of what looked like a piece of toasted coconut pie. Now mind you I have no idea what this dessert is supposed to look or taste like but my wife does and was she disappointed.  She took one bite and knew it was all wrong. I tried a bite and noticed a slight bitter taste and a bland taste from the \"bottom crust\". Well much to my surprise that \"crust\" was actually cheese. Way dried out. The shredded filo on top was dried out as well, not flaky and moist like it should be. I actually had a little trouble cutting it with a knife. I think the best part of the dish was the sliced strawberry that came on the side.\n\nAll in all the food was \"ok\". Nothing to write home about. We probably won't be going back again.

First things first, they arrived almost two hours early without giving us a heads up, which I consider to be very rude.  Luckily my husband was there, otherwise I would not have opened the door for these men because frankly, they were scary looking.  I'm going to be very nice here and say that they didn't look professional at all.  I don't expect a home inspector to wear a three piece suit and tie, but taking a shower once in a while and wearing a set of clothes that didn't go through a wood chipper seven times would help make a better impression.  The younger man, Michael, said he was going to walk around the outside with his dad, Joseph, who we were told was training him to be a home inspector.  We were going to join them so we could get feedback on the condition of the siding but Joseph said no, absolutely not, which I thought was really strange.  My husband and I were miffed but said nothing.  Our real estate agent was there and though she said nothing, I could tell she was less than happy.  She said she knows most of the home inspectors in the area but had never met or heard of these two men.  She said the fact that they wouldn't allow us to tag along was really suspicious.\n\nActually, they wouldn't let us follow them into any of the rooms.  I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, but my husband was getting very angry and eventually insisted that he follow them upstairs.\n\nAfter they were done, we asked what the issues were and they had about a billion of them.  Most of them we knew for a fact were not true.  They said our chimney was filthy and hadn't been cleaned in at least ten years and that our oil burner was on its last legs.  We had the chimney cleaned and the oil burner inspected only a few months ago.  Our burner looks brand new, and we've never had any issues with it.\n\nThey said our garage was about to collapse because the main beam was severely bent and we would have to put a lally column in the middle of it, which would make the garage unusable.  My husband at that point pretty much exploded and said, \"That beam is perfectly straight!  Did you even bother to put a level next to it?\"  And Michael said, \"No, I just eyeballed it.\"  They went on and on, pretty much reducing me to tears.  They said our house was unsellable at this point and we would have to invest 75,000 dollars in various repairs.  Our house is not perfect, that's for sure, but I wouldn't call it unsellable.  We are house hunting and have seen houses in much worse shape than ours selling for a lot more than our asking price would be.  My husband stopped Michael in mid sentence, wrote him a check for four hundred dollars, and told him to leave and not come back.  \n\nWe hired another home inspector to look at a property were thinking of buying a few days later.  Our real estate agent was there and asked the inspector if he knew who Michael and Joseph Scuduto were.  He rolled his eyes and said they have a very bad reputation.  He said if a potential buyer has them for their home inspection it's almost guaranteed that they will walk away.  The agent for the seller had even worse things to say about them.  She told me Michael wasn't a trainee like we were told, but actually runs the business.  Joseph had his license suspended so Michael had to take over the business.  We were pretty shocked to hear this.\n\nI don't know these men from Sam, I just chose them because of the positive reviews online.  I definitely have nothing personal against them, but my husband and I don't appreciate being lied to.  Truth be told, I'm suspicious of some of the five star reviews because the wording of a lot of them are very similar.  If you want to go with these fellows, that's your call, but don't be surprised if they tell you that your property or a house you're planning to buy is a death trap.  I would definitely recommend a second opinion, which we plan on getting soon.\n\nP.S.  I know this review is way too long already, but along with outright lying to us about the condition of our house, they pulled the hose off our oil tank, gouged our walls with their metal ladder and left their dirty fingerprints all over everything.  This review is just the tip of the iceberg too.  I only mentioned a few of the things that they did and lied to us about in the review because otherwise it would be 10 pages long.

After dining at Agora Cafe recently, I was expecting to hound the waitstaff for garlic and I did.\n\nWhat is it about these places that claim to serve foods from the Middle East/Mediterranean?  They must be so deathly afraid to have garlic waft into the mouths and noses of the public.  They desperately don't want to lose customers.  Apparently.\n\nWe started dinner off with the complimentary homemade pita bread, \"garlic\" sauce and yogurt/mint/cucumber sauce.  I could really taste the mint in the yogurt dipping sauce.  I'd skip the garlic dip.  Not sure what it's made of so why ingest calories that don't make your mouth sing? \n\nThen, we ordered the mezza plate.  It had the babaganoush, hummus, tabouleh,  and 4 falafel balls.  The falafel balls tasted good, but they were fried a bit too much.  The babaganoush didn't have that smoky flavor.  The hummus was ok.  I could really tasted the tahini in it.  The tabouleh wasn't fresh but tasted good.\n\nI had the #6 plate.  It came with 2 falafel balls, hummus, tabouleh, kufte (meat on the skewer), roasted tomato, and rice.  The flavors were mostly on target except for that essential ingredient.  Along with the entrees, we got a little serving of the tahini sauce and the mayo/garlic/oil sauce.   You're supposed to use these sauces on the meats and drizzle them in the pita pocket sandwiches you make.   I was not impressed with the tahini sauce.  Aside from the distinct flavor and texture of the tahini, I'm not sure what they put into it.  Perhaps water and some salt.   The mayo/garlic/oil dip was different.  I could taste the garlic in it, however, the other filler ingredient seemed to cancel it out mostly. \n\nOverall, we were satisfied with our food.  And then, I decided to order the Kunefe (or as they spelled it Kunafa).  It's a dessert made from shredded fillo dough.  It's supposed to be fluffy and moist with either a milky center or filled with pistachios.  This one had both, to some extent.   I do not recommend this to anyone.  The milky layer was tough like a dehydrated,  aged and texturized vegetarian protein substance.  The pistachio layer left a funny bitter taste in my mouth.  The fillo dough was negligibly present.  We couldn't even cut through it with our forks and it took some effort to chew our bites.\n\nI am not exaggerating any of this.  The dessert looked and tasted like it was made last week and sat under the heating lamp for a few days.\n\nI have a feeling that lunchtime is a better option at Sultan's.

Mike was on his knees crawling around under the deck, climbing the ladder IN the closet to squeeze himself through the narrow opening to the attic crawlspace (which must have been close to 100*), basically scouring every dark nook and cranny.  By the end of it, dirty hands and knees, sweating, probably with mulch clinging to his facial hair and cobwebs dangling from his ponytail.  \n\nAll in all, they were incredibly thorough.

He did not greet me, shake my hand, look me in the eyes or show the least bit of compassion or understanding when he walked into the treatment room to see me and his demeanor did not change our entire visit except he finally made eye contact that felt about as judgmental as it gets.

He didn't shake my hand or introduce himself, he barely looked at me while speaking. He proceeded to lecture me on my past treatments on and off the entire appointment.  His treatment style and options were so much better, come to realize after researching and discussing with other professionals, I'm not sure this guy went to med school at all. I felt judgment and disrespect right off the bat. It's like he didn't hear anything I said.   He told me that he could not offer me any medications I had previously been on, No discussion about it, just judgment and arrogance on something he didn't consider or understand. He didn't want to talk about it, just lecture me. He was completely closed minded and seemed annoyed by me the entire time giving me his \"opinion\" on it at length. I am quite educated on my health and health care and take all the propper steps and channels to care for my body as well as I can with the circumstance I am in. I am a realistic person that would be open to other options for my healthcare and welcome an educated discussion on prescribed medication. To just say \"I don't prescribe medication to people who.....\"   I do not appreciate paying big money to be judged and belittled.  The worst part was I didn't go in there begging for pain meds but he right off the bat blurted out he wouldn't give them to me.  I was just stunned. He didn't agree with what worked before. \nNext the exam portion.

However, this review is not about getting pregnant or not; it is more about the overall experience.\n\nDoctors:\nMy doctor was Paula Amato.  She was just OK.  However, at OHSU Fertility you only occasionally work with your actual doctor.  Throughout the process I saw several different doctors.  I didn't really mind this but it wasn't explained up front and that is off-putting.  My least favorite was one of the white, male doctors.  At this point, I am not sure if that was Seifer or Patton.  I would describe this guy as Vagina Aggressive.  Come on dude, you go into vaginas for a living, be nice to them!  I always left appointments with him in a lot of pain.  \nThe only doctor I really liked was Dr. David Lee.  Dr. Lee was my one good experience with OHSU Fertility.  He was the only one who was kind and explained procedures thoroughly.  I would have had Dr. Lee be my doctor, but there was no point since every procedure involved a different doctor anyway.\n\nNurses:\nIVF is a crazy process!  It is time sensitive and there is a ton of information that comes at you very quickly.  The nurses are the ones that communicate all the information.  They are hard to get a hold of by phone and prefer to do all the interactions through MyChart.  At one point, I picked up a giant grocery bag's worth of medication from the pharmacy and was only given a video on how to deal with it.  The nurse seemed really put off when I brought all of my medication into the office and wanted to be shown how to give myself all the different kind of shots.  I had to use youTube to really figure out the best way to do it.  \nAlso, I thought it was really weird that they made everything so time sensitive, but when I said that I had a conflict they just moved the dates back as if time didn't matter in the process.  It all makes you feel more like a paycheck than a patient.  \n\nBilling:\nMultiple stars should be taken away just for the interactions with to OHSU Fertility's billing department.  They call this person a Financial Counselor but the counseling is a mere \"how will you pay me and when will I get the money.\"  I get that these services are expensive and that the money is expected up front, but they offer very little empathy on the financial side of things.  \nA week before my egg extraction the Councilor called me and told me that the amount of money I would owe that week was nearly double what they quoted me in the first session.  So, all of a sudden I had to come up with way more money that I was planning on.  By the way, it did not cost that much in the end - so I doubled my loan to pay for this procedure for nothing.  The misunderstanding between OHSU and my insurance was a whole seperate nightmare.\nOn multiple occasion I have called billing to ask questions about bills or insurance and the response was consistently cold, uncaring, and almost lazy.  For example, I received a suspect looking bill for services a year ago form an outside diagnostic lab. I called to see if OHSU Fertility billing could just verify that they worked with this lab.  The answer I got was, \"We work with a lot of outside labs. No, I can't tell you if we worked with this lab.\"  That's it, no explanation or nothing.\n It was suggested that I take out a loan to cover my insurance deductible.  OHSU Fertility works with with Arc Fertility which will give you a loan through NetBank.  It seems like this system really takes advantage of average folks who just want to be parents as this already very expensive process ends up costing double with the NetBank loan.\n\nThe Techs:\nLike Dr. Lee, the techs were the only other good part of my experience.  Of course, its the lowest paid, hardest working people that also have the best client-patient demeanor.  \n\nOverall:  \nYour thousands of dollars are best spent elsewhere.

A much more invasive, much more dangerous and much more expensive (imagine that!) alternative that didnt work the last three times I tried it, which he was aware of\n\nb) Take 4 advil, (apparently he thinks this will work better than the prescription anti-inflammatory meds that did nothing at all for me) completely alter my life (become a hermit) and wait for it to get better.\n\nSeriously?!?  Advil? and sit around in excruciating pain because I wont get one of your goddamn injections? I have been on percocet for 4 years and you want me to take advil?  I have half a mind to contact the AMA, because there is no doubt that they are talking patients into unnecessary, expensive therapies and while they are not dangerous per se, they carry significantly higher risk and are typically the 3rd or 4th in the pain treatment progression.\n\nI hope this helps someone to avoid this \"back of a van\" style office.", "date": "2012-06-22 20:07:50"}, {"review_id": "0mYkmOorDMA9n538VZvXGw", "user_id": "2YWWhgjihzEbkTuXbTaFDw", "business_id": "lIDp9WnMYjlbOXh3dnC19w", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 11, "funny": 1, "cool": 3, "text": "These Dr's think they walk on water.

Not only are they not cheap, it's emotional, especially when you haven't had an easy time with trying to get pregnant. \n\nWe weren't billed accurately at our first appointment, while we were waiting and standing basically right there at the desk, and it has been a s#!tshow ever since. \n\nIt's been about 9 months since that appointment, and over 6 months since our final treatment (which we are very happy to say worked!). In that time, every billing cycle (about every month and half or so) we receive a new $700 bill.

At any rate, we've tried our best to be civil, but at this point it's just ridiculous. It seems like their billing has no idea what they are doing, and because of this, they make an already delicate time very very stressful.

It has taken me almost a year to write this review because it is so emotional and personal. But, I think it's important because I don't want what happened to me to happen to you.\n\nI'm writing this review not to goad more anger or hate, but as a means to offer protection to women, men, and couples undergoing what can be one of the most amazing AND one of the most vulnerable times of your life: trying to have a baby. \n\nWhen you are scared and hopeful, there is a need to have someone set the structure, tone, and provide accurate and knowledgeable care. \n\nThis did not happen at OHSU's fertility clinic, which runs a lot like a puppy mill.\n\nI saw a different doctor each time, despite having a main doctor. All the tests and procedures were done in different buildings, meaning that I had to keep track of which building, and drive to that location. \n\nI couldn't schedule an appointment with my doctor, even a 15-minute phone appointment had to be scheduled 1-2 months in advance!\n\nOHSU uses an email system, which meant they often delivered messages, but without the explanation of the medical/lab terminology. At one point, given their sloppiness, I was told I had an STD, which was incorrect, but this speaks to how disorganized their system is. I felt like a number with a wallet.\n\nWe were treated as though we weren't a couple because we were gay. Each time I called to make an appointment, I was asked if my husband was coming. Even if I were a single heterosexual woman, this would feel invalidating. Only my photograph was taken, and there was no acknowledgement that I have a partner. \n\nLastly, and most importantly, I was given the sense that I could have a child, if I just tried hard enough. It was suggested by the nurse not the doctor that I do IVF, but the doctor said I could do either. There was no direction. I asked for an ultrasound to make sure I had enough follicles (for eggs), and I was told OHSU only offered that procedure to people undergoing IVF.\n\nAfter a year, I switched doctors at OHSU, and though my doctor was sweet and gentle (unlike the female OBGYN, ironically), he was equally unavailable, and also gave me the sense that I could have a child.\n\nAfter nearly $8,000, and a year and a half of testing and procedures, OHSU finally performed an AMH test on me. It turns out that I was not given all the fertility tests when I first went to OHSU. \n\nMy FSH level was tested without my AMH level being tested (FSH is a blood test while AMH tests the number of follicles you have to produce eggs). \n\nMany experts say that AMH is the Gold Standard for fertility. \n\nI was in my mid-late 30's when I went for my first appointment at OHSU, and never had an AMH test! This was a gross error.  \n\nBecause no explanation came with my lab results at OHSU, despite calling and emailing them for over 2 weeks, I decided to get a second opinion. I went to Oregon Reproductive Medicine, THANK GOODNESS, where they told me that I had more chance to win the lottery than have a child, even with IVF! \n\nI had been doing the least invasive form of fertility, IUI, and was being told by the Number 1 place in the country for IVF, that my AMH was too low to have a child using the most invasive form of fertility treatment! (My AMH was .001, and it has to be at least .3 for IVF).\n\nNonetheless, my doctor at OHSU emailed and said that he still thought IUI would work, and did I want to have an ultrasound? Now. After nearly 2 years of asking to have an ultrasound, he offered it. He also suggested that I should have hope. \n\nThis is brutal for someone trying to have a baby. \n\nI tried to file a complaint with the OHSU patient advocacy chapter, but my case was ruled that the doctors acted properly, despite the fact that I didn't have all the tests done in over a year and a half. \n\nI spent nearly $8,000 on procedures not covered by insurance which wouldn't have been spent if only OHSU had done the proper testing. And, it broke my heart.\n\nI ask you to ask yourself: where do you want to be treated with care, as a human being? If you want kind, thorough care with a structure and doctors you can actually access, don't go to OHSU.

In all honesty, I wasn't impressed.  Initially, I was supposed to meet with Dr. Matt McCarty.  At my appointment, when the doctor entered the room, he failed to introduce himself.  I was under the impression I was meeting with the person I'd set the appointment with, when in actuality, I was really meeting with Dr. Gus Lowry, Dr. McCarty's partner.\n\nI found Dr. Lowry's attitude flippant and his demeanor cold.  Allow me to explain: I'd sent a very carefully worded letter prior to my appointment, clearly outlining the kind of services I was looking for.  Since I'd just moved to Austin from central Illinois, I was looking for a doctor to take over my current treatment and to possibly help me find even better treatments that would work with the three diagnosed chronic pain issues I have.  \n\nWhen Dr. Lowry entered the office, he held my letter in his hand, said he'd had a chance to read it, but his temperament felt icy.  In the note, I clearly outlined what I was taking to manage my pain, why and when I'd been put on which medication, and how each helped (or didn't) the individual problems. At first, Lowry seemed interested, asking symptom specific questions, discussing the overall effectiveness of past treatments, etc.  It wasn't long into our conversation, though, that he told me a well-known moderate to medium pain medicine was an opiate (when it's clearly not), and that's always a huge red flag for me!\n\nThe medication in question, Tramadol, while a schedule 4 drug in the US, is NOT a narcotic.  It's an opioid, a weak reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine.  An opioid does not an opiate make, however! \n\nBeyond that, Dr. Lowry deemed that the dosage of Tramdol I'd been on for years (with a well established personal physician) was way too much, that I was only absorbing so much of the drug, and asked me to cut the dosage by HALF for a one month trial.  I was incredibly uncomfortable with the idea, but I wanted to show that I was open to new methods of treatment, so while we waited for a DNA test that he suggested (seriously, his one good idea), I tried his drastic hack and slash.\n\nI'd asked Lowry, point blank, if I had troubles with the reduction, if he'd return my initial dosage.  He agreed that he would.\n\nTwo weeks in, I knew the suggested dosage he'd given me wasn't going to work.  I was definitely open to other ideas, but in order to even revisit the discussion again, I had to schedule (and PAY for) another appointment.  Lowry would take no calls and even though he agreed to go back to the initial dosage in my first appt, he made me meet with Dr. McCarthy's nurse prac to get resolution.  \n\nUnfortunately, the nurse turned out to be even _worse_ than Lowry, himself.  Like an empty vessel, she had to be filled with Lowry's baseless opinions on my \"conditions\" (this review is already too long to go into detail, but if you want to know more about this, feel free to msg me).  \n\nDespite Lowry's promise to reinstate my dosage, he told her to relay to me that if I wanted to continue on with his suggested dosage and wait for the results of the DNA test (that could be anywhere from 4-10 weeks, depending on which practitioner I spoke to), he'd be willing to continue seeing me.\n\nI had to laugh.  I rolled my eyes and walked out, followed by the apologetic nurse.\n \nIn truth, I wouldn't rank Balcones with any stars if the possibility existed.  In my opinion, the entire experience rated a big FU.\n\nI would also be careful of past positive ratings for this firm.  That's not to say that maybe there aren't people they've helped (God, I would hope so!!  What's the point of being in pain medicine if not to treat people who need help??).

I was In military hospitals for over a month and 1/2 and never have received such treatment from somebody (doctors) as I had that day. Oh, his method of treatment was nothing, because he never stated it to me. He belittled me and kept slamming me for serving in the army. Oh, I take that back he did tell me that i should seek therapy. His staff was also as bad and disrespectful, be warned about the billing department. He charges 250.00 and even higher if you dont have insurance. Tricare (insurance for the military-active duty and retired) was shocked when I spoke with them how high his \"new patient\" fees were and was told that they are looking into why his charges differ. The staff and Mr. McCarty and NOT a military friendly business.  One thing i did find odd was that they did urinalysis for street drugs (i dont do them so i have nothing to hide) BUT the way it is monitored. The container did not have my name and i was not escorted to the latrine. In the military not only are you escorted but viewed (im aware that im no longer in the military). My social, name (first/last) where not even on the container. So i just put it in the basket (empty). No one was there to question why it was empty or view that i put an empty container \"in the basket\". That is just flat out sloppy and another reason to charge you 50.00. I respect those who have an opinion regarding the wars and even the military BUT that should not affect my medical treatment.  I then went to another local doctor, no problems. The odd thing i do see is that he has this \"mightier than god attitude\" and talked down to me (i am 40). I stil to this day am shocked that this business is still there.  Like J.S I should have stood up for myself and walked out, now i know better and plan to do so. The gift of it all is i now have a great doctor and the VA has given me excellent health care. He never came across as a healthcare provider but more as someone that has the authority to \"play god\" and be a big \"bully\" that you had you had to put up with in high school.", "date": "2011-09-12 06:50:57"}, {"review_id": "PInxn-J4GhlHLy-1eKwyjQ", "user_id": "MbQLuevsdnnX6WFZdiwAjQ", "business_id": "cKGGxYrJPukhvyzP_ErCYQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 13, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a tough review to write.

I PRAY she finds a better clinic to work for one day so that I can return as her patient again. I went to BPC for a few years for severe back and neck issues. Kim is really the only person I saw on a regular basis. Dr. Ozuna was my physician for awhile until he left a couple years ago. Then, I got put under Dr. Lowry's \"care\". He saw me about two times in the 3, or so, years I was his patient, and I had monthly appointments throughout that time. He doesn't know me from any other stranger. Kim, on the other hand, got to know me on a personal level and has compassion for her patients. I am no longer with them because I received a certified letter in the mail a couple months ago stating that Dr. Lowry was dropping me from the practice for canceling appointments. Um...what? Oh! That's right! This guy considers rescheduling appointments as cancelled appointments. What??? And, no, I didn't call the day before an appointment expecting to be fit in at a better time. These were rescheduled a couple weeks in advance, if not sooner. Some of these appointments were rescheduled due to the appointment scheduled not realizing they'd given me an appointment on a day Kim wouldn't be available, so they'd call me to change the appointment themselves. I'm sorry, morning appointments don't always work for me, or vice versa, so excuse me for calling to reschedule to a better time in the day. I tried fixing the issue, I called to speak with the office manager, and nothing. At my last appointment with Kim, she didn't even know Dr. Lowry had done this to me. Great communication, Dr. She tried fixing it, as well, and he still refused to accept me back despite the fact that she vouched for me, herself.  I did say I would not reschedule any more appointments, but it didn't matter, the dude was too busy with his injections and other procedures to care. That is where he makes his money, anyway. Again, I hope Kim goes to a better practice one day. I'll gladly see her again. Oh! He also discharged me when I still had one more set of injections needing to be done to complete the set of injections that he had started on me a couple weeks before.

The Physiatrist was unable to help me so I sought out further treatment and that is when I first became a patient of Dr. Matt McCarty.

My fiance and I are first-time homebuyers and we began our home search last spring (2016) in the Marlborough area. A co-worker recommended Tri-Value and I couldn't be happier that we chose them as our home inspectors.  Joe and Mike have been the only two people throughout the home buying process that I felt truly had OUR best interest at heart as buyers.  They were always early, incredibly knowledgeable and helped us to uncover major issues on both houses we had accepted offers on (major structural issues on the first house and roof issues on the 2nd - both needed immediate attention) that would have cost us thousands of dollars to repair.  Ultimately, after some second opinions, we ended up backing out of the first house and the sellers backed out of the second. Thanks to Joe and Mike, we were able to make fully educated decisions throughout the process.\n\nI've read through some of the negative reviews on here, especially the ones complaining about all of the issues they point out...but is that not the point of a home inspector?  It is their job to point out any issues they spot, however big or small, and trust me - they will not leave any stone unturned.  Additionally, their level of detail was super helpful for my fiance and I.  Given that we were first-time homebuyers, they took tons of time walking us through their findings and answered all of our questions thoughtfully and thoroughly.  They really catered to us and made sure we had everything we needed - Joe even gave me his jacket to wear while we were out in the rain going over the outside of the house :)\n\nLong story short, if you want to make a fully educated decision about purchasing a home, Joe and Mike are the absolute best.

I was referred to them during my first pregnancy and had two ultrasounds, spending probably 6 hours there, 20 minutes of which with a doctor. Fast forward to my second pregnancy and I thought that I would have my two visits and be done. For my 20 week ultrasound we sat and waited for an hour and a half to be seen. It is very frustrating to hear the staff order lunch and eat it when you know you had a 10 am appointment. But silly me didn't say anything because 1) after you have sat there for so long you are committed and it has to be \"any minute now\" and 2) I wanted to make sure everything with the baby was okay.  No concerns were addressed during my 10 minutes with the doctor. At my follow up appointment we once again waited for well over an hour and when the doctor was finally in the room mention that the baby has a marginal umbilical cord insertion and I would need follow up visits every month until I deliver. No additional comments or even an acknowledgement that they didn't mention it during my previous visit. So we schedule a third appointment to see the doctor and due to Atlanta traffic, showed up a few minutes late. I didn't think to call because EVERY SINGLE VISIT I have been kept waiting for well over an hour. I didn't think 20 minutes would even be noticed. Well it turns out when the doctor decides she doesn't want to see you, she just doesn't. There were still techs there as well as Dr. Fogel whom I was scheduled to see and she refused. There was a specific medical concern beyond a routine visit that we were there for and she couldn't even accommodate me for TEN minutes. That is all it would have taken.

I have never experienced such horrible customer service in my life, NEVER. I went in with my small child and sister to get products for my daughters hair, in preparation for an event the next day. I walked by several associates and was never offered assistance. Instead, we were followed around through out the whole store, the whole entire time we were there. \n\nI know following occurs at stores, but I never experienced it to this magnitude. I have never stolen anything in my life and can't imagine going into a store to steal with a small child in tow.. what would I be showing my daughter? I also have too much pride and dignity to do such a thing. My family has owned several businesses and I have gone through extensive schooling and would never tarnish my name or self worth. but i digress.. \n\nAfter noticing we have been followed for an extended period of time, I really did not want to purchase anything from the store and contemplated if I wanted to actually spend my money in the store. The money that I earn after completing my degree, which led to a career that allows me to purchase things I need and want. After much debate, I decided I was going to purchase something, just to show them I am able to make the purchase. I purchased it.. and didn't even make it out the door when I felt this knot in my stomach. \n\nI went back to the register and told the associate that I wanted to return the products. She didn't ask me why or anything and proceeded to accept my return. At that time, I felt that I had to let them know why I was returning the product... So I said to her that I am simply returning this product based on the service, or lack of service, that I received that evening. \n\n* I explained that I had been followed the whole time that I was in the store. I also shared that I have never stolen anything in my life and this was by far the worst customer service I have ever received. I also shared that it was my first time at an ulta store and I am highly disappointed in how I was treated..\n\nDO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ASSOCIATE SAID TO ME???\nShe said, not to take it personal that they were following me. She said they have to do it because it is the holidays and they have to deal with theft during this time of year. She also said.. 'Do you know how much little lipsticks and shadows we have?' She said they had to follow us to make sure we were not going to steal. \n\nMy response was, as a customer, I should NEVER have to feel like I am being followed..I also share that I shop at sephora for my beauty needs and have never been followed. Her response , was they have a lot of employees. She proceeded to tell me not to take it personal and offered to call the manager. I was too upset and didn't want a scene so I left. \n\nIn my car, I decided to call and requested to speak to the manager. The manager identified herself as holly. I explained my experience and said that I just wanted her to be aware, as this was my first time ever in an ulta store..\n\nAll she said to me was 'I'm sorry you feel this way, do you want the name of someone else to call'. I said that is not necessary and her response was... 'SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF THIS' \n\nLOL.. Is this really real life? Aren't you suppose to share your experience with a manager , if that experience was less than satisfactory? I asked if I can have the names of the associates so when I call their corporate office but was denied. \n\nI know, based on other reviews and past lawsuits, their corporate office, may feel the same as they  do and not even care that a customer (like me) was made to feel so horrible.", "date": "2014-12-06 03:48:23"}, {"review_id": "7AZDB_jObEppDkZHPFy-9g", "user_id": "jN8LlghQi1yxRtX4I6CFMg", "business_id": "UIbfR8ixuYCpozP1fpTs1Q", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Turkish food truck near PSU.

I wish I had 20 stars to give them. I understand that often it is the OB who \"works\" with specific perinatal practices and so the decision as to whom you will be seen by is not always made by the patient, but if you do have a choice, pick this practice and in particular, Dr. Trevett who was my doctor.\n\nFirst, the wait time was always acceptable (a few times I had to wait a little more than others but never more than 15-20 minutes). Note that I went there like, maybe 20 times throughout my pregnancy (at one point I was going once and sometimes twice a week, so I got to know the place pretty well). The receptionists were always pleasant. It is true that some of the U/S techs were more verbal and engaging than others, and this was something that I personally did not like. When you have one person explaining everything, and even commenting how great things look etc, and then the next time a different person says nothing, and is short even when you ask questions, well, then you get a little worried (or paranoid if you were like I was when I was pregnant). Also, some techs would try and take good \"pics\" of the baby to send you home with, and a few others just didn't care. \n\nTechs are not as important as the dr is however. For me as long as the dr is good and explains everything, you are fine. And Dr. Trevett was indeed always there to answer questions and to give advise. Although he had already studied the U/S slides he would re-do the U/S while in the room with me. He did not seem in a rush, he had excellent manners, and most importantly he was always reassuring, but at the same time very conservative with advise. Like, for example, when I asked if it was OK to had my hair colored, something that many physicians are OK with, he suggested to not risk it, although everything was progressing great with my pregnancy. And he would make these suggestions in a calm, confident, and non-alarmist way. Again, for someone who suffered severe pregnancy anxiety, he was exactly the type of dr that was needed. \n\nIn my last appointment he suggested that I go into labor, that very same day. He delivered the shocking news in such delicate manner that I didn't even freak out. OK, maybe a little bit when it started sinking in that I was not going back to work that day, and I was gonna meet someone new before the night falls...But not at that moment. At that moment Dr. T made me feel so sure about the whole \"you're having a baby today\" that this memory is marked only by positive, happy feelings.

The cashier was extremely rude and spoke to me like I was an idiot because one of the coupons I had presented wasn't for the *prestige* make up. I told her I knew that and would like to use it for something else, and showed her the other coupon which was acceptable. She huffed and processed the rest of my transaction. When I told her I wanted to also receive my free mascara for my birthday, she told me not only could she not give me the mascara because they were out of stock, but because my coupon was invalid. I needed two bar codes to scan for the product. I glared at her, flipped over the page to show her the second bar code had printed on the back (ever heard of double sided printing?!) and she told me again she couldn't process the transaction, but to call ahead and see when they would have them, because she didn't know.\n\nI got home, opened my make up kit, and noticed that a powder was missing. This sent me over the ledge. Now I had to return to the store to exchange it for a complete pack. Fast forward 24 hours and I'm back at the store. As I am on my way to the Bare Minerals section, I notice there is only one cashier (who is actually the store manager) and the line wraps around the aisles. I took a deep breath and perused the store for nothing in particular as I waited for the line to go away. Keep in mind, it's a Saturday around noon. The line isn't going anywhere. I grab the item I want to exchange and I get in line. Some 15-20 minutes later, I'm almost next. The thing is, I could have been helped so long ago, but there is too much gabbing going on. I'm all for customer service and being nice, but when you are the ONLY person at check out and have a line AROUND the aisle, you need to be professional AND time efficient. The only saving grace was the Clinique lady handed out free samples as crowd control. \n\nI exchanged my item and was out of there, but that is no way to run a business.

This place may have your answer. \n\nI walked in and I had the Doner Kebab sandwich. It's not really a sandwich, it's more like a pile of meat, mixed with lettuce, tomatoes, marinated in some sort of garlic sauce and wrapped in a pita bread. I had the chicken version of the Doner Kebab, and it was fairly tasty. They were really generous with the chicken portions, the flavor of the marinade made the chicken tasty despite the somewhat dryness in the texture. The tomatoes were fresh, and the garlic sauce made the lettuce tastier. The pita bread is not very rigid to hold all these chicken pieces so you may need a fork to finish up your dish. The pita bread was decently good. One Doner Kebab sandwich should be enough to fill up the stomach of a hungry man, and it is under $10 but more than $8, making the price a little steep. \n\nI also had one of their Chicken Boreks. A Borek is a pastry that has its origins from Turkey, and is very popular in countries that were influenced by the Ottoman Empire (such as Albania, Bulgaria, and Croatia). It is made from a flaky dough that is called \"phyllo\". I really liked the somewhat crisp and flaky texture on the outside, and the flavor of the chicken was all right, but needed to be a little warmer. One borek should be enough for a large snack, just like a Chinese Cha Siu Bau (roast pork bun) or a Jing Dai Bau (steamed big bun) from a Chinese bakery. One piece is not too expensive, about $2.75 and it's a great choice if you want something really light to eat. \n\nThe service could use some improvement but only in terms of niceness and sincerity. One of the people who worked there was somewhat rude to me when I ordered, and there was no queue. The only good part is the service can be very effective and I got my order in less than 7 minutes. \n\nThe name Sultan's Kitchen sounds really generic and a little hackneyed. This is only a suggestion, but I think if they want to give this place a more significant and unique Turkish \"vibe\", maybe they should call it \"Sultan Mutfagi\" (with the \"yumusak ge\" letter and the dotless \"i\" letter). \n\nOverall, this is a solid choice if you want some Turkish and Middle Eastern influenced dishes.

Never having been to Turkey myself, I can't comment upon the authenticity of his d\u00f6ner, I can only say that the lamb and beef version is saucy and delicious. The d\u00f6ner (or gyro or whatever you want to call it) here is unlike any I've had before. The flatbread isn't thick and bready like in Western Europe; on the contrary it's quite thin, totally unleavened and, after a turn in the panini press, somewhat crunchy. Apparently it's known as d\u00fcr\u00fcm.  There's some vegetables, mostly iceberg mix and tomatoes, and a lot of sauce. The \"spicy\" sauce is, as I've come to expect from western d\u00f6ner renditions, not really very spicy, more just wet and slightly earthy. The yogurt sauce is the real star of the show, tangy, tart and cool, the sandwich is both bathed in it and proudly topped with a generous dollop as if to say \"bite it, heart.\" I can really only recommend the Lamb version, I have to agree with other reviewers that the chicken is distinctly unexciting, and a little salty. \nFortunately the Iskender plate is also successful. A bunch of crackered up flatbread is spread on a plate, then baked with red sauce and d\u00f6ner meat. Topped, of course, with the familiar yogurt sauce, it's a satisfying meal for one. Better still is the housemade Baklava. Better than most (maybe all?) in the Portland area it suffers from none of the soggy, collapsed, \"all of a mass\" quality that plagues most area Baklava.\nHonestly, considering the chicken, it's a four star, but considering the graciousness of the proprietor and the amount of negative press it's gotten here on Yelp, I'm giving it five to, as I say, even out the hate.", "date": "2011-11-09 20:38:22"}, {"review_id": "Upqik_z063qKSHJeb1DXNQ", "user_id": "ymiohz-DlNLHGAlXbVhw5A", "business_id": "UIbfR8ixuYCpozP1fpTs1Q", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Excellent truck in the PSU pod.

Two of the 3 items I wanted to return for something else. My teen and her father (enough said) didn't hold on to the receipt. The stores online policy states with no receipt you will get the lowest price that the items ring up. This manager said that they \"cant not be returned OR exchanged without a receipt AT ALL\". Then goes on to tell me she has no proof that they were even bought there. My daughter who was with me and the beauty adviser who was also in the store recognized each other and confirmed he was the one who sold the items to her just two days prior.  This manager went on to say that she STILL wasnt taking them back without a receipt, there was nothing she could do and shrugged her shoulders as I was on the phone with Ulta customer service where a very nice woman was trying to find the receipt in the system. At the same time the woman on the phone was saying she doesn't understand why the manager was being difficult and that I should escalate the encounter, which I have.

Anyways, I called and made an appointment to see Kanar, but something came up on that day so I called to see if I could do it sooner. Mercy picked up the phone and told me she was available. I should have known right then that something was up if she had such open availability. She seemed so nice on the phone I thought why not. The experience was totally different once I got there. She was incredibly negative. My hair was pretty damaged from going blonde so the chop was to revive it and she kept telling me that my hair would still be damaged no matter what I did because of how I went blonde. To me it seemed super hypocritical especially because she has bright blue and purple hair. Her hair at the ends were fried, but she going to come for my hair which I was trying to revive with a good cut. She kept telling me how I should have never went blonde and was basically just bad mouthing my choice of hair color (she is literally the first and only person, everyone loves my blonde.) My friend came with me and we tried to make conversation but she was really rude and everything that came out of her mouth was negative. I showed her two pictures of what I wanted and this women basically did whatever the hell she wanted. My hair is not even, the sides are way to short, I have short chunks and then long ones. When she finished, she kept styling it horribly and I kept telling her what I wanted but I guess she just does whatever she wants. I was literally crying in my seat with super short hair and a hairstylist who had no way of resolving the situation. She ended up charging me for just a cut and not style because I was so disappointing. Moral of the story go to the hairstylist you have a history with and you know is good.

I was told that tommy could fix the mess that the other Salon did,I set an appt for the following day.

She argued with me and told me I was given a price quote Sunday because its sitting right in front of her. I told that was not true and that someone was supposed to call me with that information. She basically in so many words called me a liar and put me hold to confirm whether or not I was given a price quote. She comes back to the phone and says I was correct and that she assumed I was given a price. No apologies for the way she treated me. I proceeded to ask her how much I would cost to repair my hair. I told her my appt was in 2 hours and I wanted to know going into it what the approximate cost would be. What came next was absolutely mind blowing. She advised me that SHE cancelled my appt and I should go somewhere else. I was blown away, ULTA MESSED UP MY HAIR and I was trying to do the right thing and have them correct it and was treated like absolute SHIT!!!!

Though it wasn't the flavor explosion of lemon, parsley and mint that I'm partial to, it definitely added another lovely dimension to the sammie.  It was all rounded out with fresh greens, and I thought the menu said tomatoes but I didn't get any, which suited me fine.

PLus they have lost a very loyal customer who brought many friends to them. \n\nHere is what happened.\n\nI went there today with a friend. 2 incidents ruined our experience - one of them actually a health hazard. The person we dealt with is the oldest guy who I have seen at the restaurant many times before. He is always rude. Period. But this time it just wasn't tolerable.\n\n1. When I bought something less than $10 and took out the credit card, he rolled his eyes and pointed to the sign that said \"no credit cards for purchases less than $10\". Then within the seconds that I was picking between a bill of 10 or 20 to give him, he acted like I am wasting too much of his time. Mind you no other customer was waiting. I still gave him a benefit of doubt thinking I might be reading too much into rolling the eyes - until the 2nd incident.\n\n2. In our Bakhalava, we found something metallic. Small but sharp pieces of metal. When we showed that to him, he looked at those again and again. Then came back with an aluminum foil and told us \"It's JUST the foil.\" As startled as we were at his response, we still said, it's much harder than the foil. And even if it were the foil, it's still not acceptable. Then he just asked us rudely,  \"What do you want me to do, ha? Do you want me to return your $2?\". My friend said that an apology would be a good start. He modified his words a little, \"ok. I am sorry. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to return your $2?\"  We were so shocked to see his apathy that we took the money and left instantly. \n\nOnly to vow that we will never return to what used to be my most favorite kabab place in Boston. :(", "date": "2013-08-01 01:09:34"}, {"review_id": "cNF5bgflYMHMTROOSczw3A", "user_id": "kW4-WIFsPQMJe7MPgXaYlg", "business_id": "Ja1M8VECtR5Y3OjwHqISvw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 10, "funny": 17, "cool": 6, "text": "This review is about the extremely rude owner and chef of Sultan's Kitchen.

Just in the last year, I've probably spent well over a 3 grand.  I've always had a good experience at this store until today!  My purpose of my visit was to exchange my drybar wrap party wand and shampoo/conditioner.  I got the drybar for Christmas and was purchased in Jantzen Beach and the one I got has been used.  Fingerprints and everything, it was gross!  My sister lives out of town and left the drybar shampoo/conditioner at my house and changed her mind about so she asked me to return it for her. The cashier (Cat) asked me why I was exchanging and I told her the reason.  I had to pay for the tax which was no problem.  I did question it but it was my first time doing that kind of exchange.  So, I said ok I want to return these hair products and whatever the difference is just take it off of there.  This lady looked at me like I was doing something shady.  She asked what was wrong with them and I said I'm returning it for my sister and then said, \"Were you already going to return this?\" I'm thinking why it matters.  I didn't have a problem paying the sales tax, but the thing that bothered me was this lady that lacked customer service skills made me feel like crap.  I told her I don't have an issue with paying, it was her awful treatment towards me.  A manager was standing right next to her and I explained again why I was upset.  All she said was, it was a miscommunication.  No apologies, nothing!  It was the worse experience I've every had there! I've never seen that cashier before and I hope she's just a temp!

A young lady from the office reached out to me just a few hours after my OB said she would refer me to the office, and just speaking with her over the phone put me at ease.  She explained what the visit would entail, the cost, and where the office was located, as well as which doctor I would see.  With my appointment scheduled, I decided to visit their website and printed the forms needed for new patients because hey, who wants to worry about paperwork while at a new office????\n\nThe office is located at Piedmont Hospital and my husband and I were able to park ($5 cost) in the North lot at the hospital, and take the elevator to the bridge for the hospital and looked for the signage that said \"77 Building\".  We found the elevator and all the signage made it so easy to find the office.  When we made it to the office, it was so quiet and calm.  I definitely felt at ease and when I approached the window, a young lady greeted me with a very pleasant attitude and she let me know that someone would be out to take me back to see the doc shortly.  \n\nWe waited maybe 4 minutes, and the tech, Emily, took us back to a very large room for our ultrasound and dimmed the lights and explained what the visit would entail and also explained all the images of our baby we saw and was just extremely knowledgeable.  Once she finished, Dr. Fogle entered the room and was just the absolute sweetest.  She explained all the possibilities of what may happen throughout the remainder of my pregnancy and that she would be sure to follow up with my OB (I am glad to say I received a call the next day from my OB who stated that she indeed spoke with Dr. Fogle right after my visit).\n\nI really appreciated how kind she was and I did not feel like just another patient.

I've been looking for a new stylist as I have platinum/white blonde hair, so it is a hard color to maintain and style. I understand that. First, I got approached in the store by Julie. She said she specializes in blondes and would love to touch up my hair. I was happy as like I mentioned I looking for someone new to do my hair. I called to make an apt a few days later with Julie. When I called, I spoke with Brittany. She said Julie was full on the day I wanted to come and that she would be able to do my hair. Hesitant I told her, I'm VERY blonde and asked if if she can do color like this. She said yes, so I booked my apt with her.\n\nWhen I went in the day of my apt. no one helped me for the first 5 minutes. Finally the receptionist? came out from the back. I told her I had an apt with Brittany. I then wanted for 5-10 minutes. This was my first time meeting her and as a hair stylist most are outgoing and friendly but Brittany was the absolute opposite. The first thing she basically said to me was \"I know you wanted Julie, she's here she can do it for you\". Sort of getting a weird vibe I said ok. When she went to go find Julie, she came back 5 minutes later saying she had left and that she'll do my hair. Fine. I sit down and tell her I just want my roots touched up, she acts like she has no idea what I'm talking about. She acted rude towards me when she didn't understand what I wanted and implied I didn't know exactly what I wanted? She made comments about my dead ends (like I get it I'm blonde but rude comments about them) come on. Anyways, takes 2 hours to foil my hair. I do have thick hair but shouldn't have taken that long. Brittany didn't engage with me AT ALL. Talked to her other co-workers instead of me, etc. Since it took her forever to foil my hair it was getting towards the end of the night since I did have a late apt. She didn't let my hair process NEAR long enough. The result, ORANGE hair. The store was closing and I was OVER the horrible experience so I didn't even have her blow dry or style my hair. She said she gave me a discount for this but still charged me more than i have ever paid for my hair. And tried to convince me to go back because she will \"definitely be able to get it to the exact white color next time\". I think it's just a scam to take even more of my money.\nGetting your hair done is an experience and for me something scary because I seem to always have a terrible experience. My worst fear was ending up with orange roots and that's exactly what happened.\n\nI would never recommend Brittany to anyone.

I didn't feel like going downtown today and had a craving for some lamb/beef smothered in yogurt sauce so I gave this truck a whirl despite the \"ghetto\" looking website and the less than appetizing food cart presentation..

A month ago I didn't even know what a d\u00f6ner was, but my girl growing up in germany educated me on that while in the Mississippi district where I had my 1st d\u00f6ner. Although good, it didn't seem like anything more then a gyro inside flatbread and I didn't see what the hype was about.\n\nWell fast forward to this D\u00f6ner... this one was a game changer, not only was the meat perfectly cooked and seasoned, the red and white sauces combined for perfect flavors, 70% of the d\u00f6ner was packed tight with meat giving you a feeling of real value instead of a feeling of lettuce fillers, but... the real game changer for me was the flatbread/pita/whatever type of thing they wrap it with... it was so cripsy and delicious, like a super thin toasted pita wrap.. to be technical tho, I believe this is more of a d\u00fcr\u00fcm then a d\u00f6ner as it was folded like a taco but wrapped more like a burrito.. but totally different then a gyro? if that makes since? lol but regardless it was the best lamb/beef sandwich I'd ever have regardless of the name.. and did i mention it was like 70% meat?!?! I did? ok just making sure you got that part!! \n\nNow onto the baklava.. see the thing is, i've had baklava a couple times before.. and I'm not big on sweets.. and I'm not big on remembering things that don't make a big impression on me... soo I kinda forgot I hated baklava. After the guy gave it too me I remembered :( I wanted to cancel the order but I'm not big on canceling something like that so i figured why not eat it anyways. The thing i discovered was..

I have just attempted to contact the office manager and was disconnected 3 times. Finally I reached voicemail of whom I believe is the office manager. I left a message requesting a call back. I will see if the call is returned and see if she will waive the copays. This group of doctors may not have any idea how their office is being operated.\n\nI would not recommend this climic to anyone.

Having been to many Ulta salons in Pittsburgh, I had confidence with them, so I figured everything would go smoothly. I arrived at the salon to be greeted by Anna who was very rude and barely acknowledged my presence. I sat down in the chair and showed her pictures of the exact hair process I wanted. I told her SPECIFICALLY that I wanted a blonde balayage NOT an Ombre (which I'm sure anyone reading this would know are two completely different looks). She told me at the beginning of the appointment that it would cost $162. She started working on my hair and stopped halfway to rinse another clients hair and blowdry it. 30 minutes later she returned and finished working on my hair. Keep in mind, the color that she had already put on my hair had been developing for 30 minutes, while the rest of my hair had no color on it. She had to take me over to the sink to wash out the section of my hair that had been sitting way longer than the other sections because it was done which was obviously very frustrating. She washed out that section of my hair, sat me back down in the chair, and left the salon. My mother came in 2 and a half hours into the appointment, asking how long the appointment would last. The receptionist had to CALL Anna and ask how much longer because Anna had left to go get a coffee. Anna responded saying it would take another hour. My mother demanded to talk to a manager and the manager said during the consultation Anna should have given me an estimate of time. Anna walked back into the salon, completely ignored my mother who was standing right next to me, and told me to follow her to the sink. When my mother asked about my hair, Anna was extremely rude and told my mother that we \"obviously didn't know what we were booking\". My mom said \"partial highlights should never take that long\" and Anna responded \"Ombres take three hours.\" Again, I CLEARLY REPEATED THAT I WANTED A BALAYAGE!!! An hour and a half later, she blowdryed my hair and asked if I wanted it styled. At that point, my hair looked horrendous and I just wanted to get out of the salon. My hair looks horrific. There are obvious lines between my natural hair color and the blonde she put in. It is not blended, the color is not what I asked for, and it is clearly not a balayage. When the bill came, the total was $194, not $162 like Anna had said at the beginning of the appointment. Not only did she add more color, but she also added a treatment that she never asked if I wanted. Also, Anna did not speak to me at all throughout the entire appointment. Literally, the most unprofessional experience I have ever seen in my life.

Something about walking in that store, makes me instantly hate everyone and everything around me. Because from the moment I walk in the door, it goes like this: an employee approaches me & I kindly say to them \"hi I'm here for X, Y & Z\". Prior to coming to the store, I do my online research on products i wanna try. When I find out those items are sold at Ulta, I schedule a time for myself to go In and pick it up. I know what I'm going there for. I'm just trying to get in and get out, because I don't like my time being wasted. So I'll politely tell them I don't need any assistance & go about my business, which is when they start following me and approaching me every 5 minutes.. (Next, i was going to say how I can see how my blunt attitude coming in the store could be a cause for concern but when I say that OUT LOUD? THAT is outrageous!!!!!

First let me tell you that I've been an Ulta customer for over 5 years I had minor issues before with the Salon Stlylists until I met Jay (Jonathan) a great Stylist. He took care of me for more than a year I had long black beautiful hair and because of Jay (Jonathan)I kept going back to Ulta. Last week of November I called for an appointment with him but I was told he had transfer to another location and because it is really far for me I decided to book an appointment with another stylist I let the person on the phone know that I wanted somebody who knew what they were doing because I invest a lot of time, money and care into my hair, the lady on the phone suggested that I book my appointment with the Salon manager \"Erika\" I said great the manager sounds awesome if she is the manger definitely has to be a professional.  Worst dec\u00edsion ever. I came in Nov 30th 2018 to the salon I met Erika (the salon manager)I told her what I wanted,  just to trim the ends I already have the haircut and also Showed her a picture of how my hair should look like  she said she would cut my hair once it was dry and colored \n Erika colored my hair and once it was done she starting cutting it. I felt safe because I thought she was a professional. She finished cutting my hair and started blow drying it. When my sister looked at my new haircut she was shocked and told me let me take a picture so I can see my hair immediately. I knew something was wrong. I asked Erika (the salon manager)  are you done? she said yes I just need to cut some ends but once I saw the picture I knew my hair had to be cut much higher because Erika left my hair as a five year old was playing with scissors. My hair look like sound bars. In order to correct the difference length, my hair had to be cut much shorter to make it look even. Before I walked in  I had my hair to my waist. All I wanted was a trim of the tips, and I ended up with my hair to my shoulders. I was and still am furious.  I was crying when I saw my hair. Once I asked her she said it's ok I just need to cut a little bit more she never recognized she was wrong. Erika (the salon manager )never apologized, I was so upset I told her I didn't want her to touch my hair anymore so another stylist came in and try to fix what the salon manager did to me but it was impossible to fix. I spent 5 hours at Ulta salon and three stylist tried to fix my hair. But it was a lost cause . After One of the stylist did everything he could to fix my hair he recommended me no to cut it more and wait. Other wise he would have to cut a lot more hair. Ericka the salon manager was helping other clients like nothing happened while I was sitting there crying for what she did to me and other stylists try to fix her mistake. \nThe Store manager apologized but No apologies will bring my beautiful long hair back. \nIt's disappointing to go to a place you think you will get the best service. a premium one and things like this happened all I ask is that Ericka (the salon manager) gets suspended until she is train properly to do her job I think is the least one could expect after what she did to me, if she couldn't do a simple trim. I don't know what kind of professionals is Ulta hiring.\nIt Is the company's image I will always regret going to Ulta and letting Ericka (the salon manager) touch my hair. Please be careful.

She didn't check the temperature of the wax (it was hot), and she insisted on \"coloring in\" my eyebrows when she was done before giving me the mirror. My skin is usually a little red right after waxing so I really didn't get the full effect of her handy work until several hours later. That is when, after washing my face, I found that a sizeable chunk of my left brow was missing, they were way to thin and I had small burn blisters all around my right eye! I've been waxing for 10 years and have never experienced this. I attempted to contact the store and filled out a survey with detailed information about what happened with a request that someone contact me. I also let them know several times that I wasn't looking for my money back I just wanted to make sure nobody else went through this. This was over two months ago and I haven't received any kind of communication from them.

I walked past the store a few times and thought since this a professional place, I wouldn't have any problems.

Ok I'm paying $30, I want it the way I want it. Fast forward an hour later, she curls it and I'm on my way. I even tipped her. Then I started getting extremely suspicious as to why she didn't really show me the end result. I went home and straightened it and almost cried. It was the most uneven botched job I've ever seen. I contact one of my hairstylists friends and she fixed it for me because I just couldn't go out in public. I called the store to complain, and they said I should come in. I came in after work to tell the general manager. She had absolutely no sympathy. She even blamed me saying that I ruined my hair on purpose and just was trying to get money out of them. UM HELLO. Are you serious? I proceeded to tell her I have proof from pictures and she's like we have before and after too. And that it's my fault because I didn't give them a chance to fix it. Just extremely rude and disrespectful. I couldn't believe my eyes, so I left. I called ulta and complained, although I don't think they did anything about it. \n\nEver since that experience, all of their workers are less than friendly towards me.

If she had the inclination to do so I'd think she'd do well studying to be an eye doctor. Very impressive all around.\n\nThe best part of the visit, though, was the consultation with Dr. Jennifer Casey, who listened to my specific concerns about the deterioration in my vision, ran a couple of extra tests and the explained why I was (or was not) seeing certain things in part of my field of vision the way I once did. Overall, she said my sight was sitll pretty good and that I didn't have major eye problems, just a few age-related issues. In contrast to my feelings of dread thoughts of major work in the near future I left feeling a lot better.\n\nMy next appointment isn't for another year.

They had lots of available time slots and different options which was nice and convenient.\n\nI arrived a few minutes early and Janice took me back for my shampoo shortly after I arrived. She wasn't very welcoming right off the bat, no smile or \"how are you\", which isn't what I came for but it goes a long way, especially with such an intimate service. She quickly ushered me into the shampoo chair and asked me what I wanted for my blowout. I explained to her that I wanted a sleek blowout with big, loose round brush curls at the bottom--a basic blowout in my opinion, no hot tools required. She nodded and didn't say another word to me the entire appointment. She made me feel pretty uncomfortable, like she would rather be doing anything but blow drying my hair. Not ideal, but she took her time and did a good job.\n\nMy blowout turned out pretty damn amazing. She gave me exactly what I was looking for, so I was happy on that front. After my appointment, she printed out a receipt for me and told me I could pay at the front. Upon checking out, I realized she had charged me $45 as opposed to the $35 price I was given when I booked my appointment online. I asked the girl at the register about it and she told me I would have to talk to my stylist about it since it's a different system than their registers--no biggie. I walked back to the salon and asked my stylist about it, thinking it may have been a mistake. She told me no, that was the price for the classic blowout. Even if while booking online it said a classic blowout with Janice was $35? Okay, annoying, but whatever. She just kind of shrugged at me when I questioned it and sent me back up to the front of the store. The same girl rang me up again and upon hearing that she wouldn't adjust the price of my blowout, she asked if I wanted to speak to the manager, which I agreed to. I was able to log on to their nearly impossible website from my phone and show the manager that the price for a classic blowout with that specific stylist was in fact $35, so she went back to speak with my stylist while I waited up front. \n\nWhen she came back, she had my stylist in tow and told me there was a miscommunication and Janice had given me a different and more expensive blowout and it was more expensive because of the curl/wave at the bottom??? Not only did my stylist not mention a word that the very basic style (no hot tools, only a blow dryer and round brush) blowout I was looking for was $10 extra, but she also then tried to say I had asked for a more expensive blowout, not classic. The blowout she charged me for comes with a conditioning treatment and scalp massage, neither of which I received. She then says to me \"Is this your first time ever getting a blowout?\" Here yes, but not my first and NEVER have I been charged extra for round brush loose waves. I couldn't believe it. \n\nThe manager made a point to say they will make sure there is more of an understanding between stylist and client in the future about verbalizing concerns or additional prices, and even offered to take the $10 off of my product purchase. It was a nice gesture, but I hate to say I will not be returning to this Ulta salon for any kind of service in the future. For the price I paid I could have gone to a prestigious blowout salon in Boston and gotten a lot more for my money (and probably a stylist who doesn't try and screw over her clients and actually seems like she wants to be there).

The moment I walked in, I saw a sales associate standing in front but she didn't greet me. I walked over to the \"prestige\" make up sections and the lady followed me and proceeded to stare yet not offer any help. I browsed around after looking for my mom's lipstick (which they didn't even have the right shade for...they've been out for almost 2 weeks!) and walked by at least half a dozen sales associates. Not one bothered to greet me, ask if I needed help looking for anything, or even acknowledge my presence. It's not like it was super busy--I saw a few just standing around talking to each other. I even made eye contact with an associate who just walked away. Service = 0 stars. \n\nI also noticed that the make up area isn't well kept or very clean. The testers look mangled and have product crusted all over the sides. A lot of the displays are missing their testers (you just see empty holes where the tester should have been) and seem a little unorganized. I tried out some products on my hands and when I wanted to clean it off, there was only ONE station in the entire store and it wasn't even fully stocked. There were cotton swabs, tissue, and a spray bottle of what I believe is just tap water....I still have foundation two shades too dark on my hands as I type out this review. \n\nFinally, as I was about to check out, the same sales associate that DIDN'T help me at the beginning asked if I needed any help. We talked about different products and I asked about her awesome eyelashes (perfectly fanned out and feathery, they were gorgeous)! She proceeds to tell me that she uses a particular mascara and serum (not available at Ulta) that causes them to grow extra thick and long. Umm...I can clearly see the inner corner of the falsies on your left eye starting to peel off. I stifled a laugh and was tempted to ask her the brand she wears but refrained. \n\nAll in all, Ulta is not that special to me.

There is typically always someone to help you find products when you need it.  They tend to always have sales and coupons (be careful though, the coupons tend to exclude a ton of brand names!) which is good as they tend to be higher priced however, the return policy makes it worth it in many cases, especially when you are trying a new product and you just aren't sure it will work on you until you have a chance to use it \"in the real world\". I have purchased hair care products like curling irons and straighteners that, based on reviews, I thought I would love but did not work well on my hair type.  No problem.  Just save all the packaging and receipt and return within their allowed period.  I recently purchased a couple high end lipsticks, which when I tested in the store I loved, however when I got them home, and tried them there, and in natural light, etc a few did not blend well with my skin tone.  Ulta accepted these back without issue. You must return with at least 70% of the product remaining (I returned the next day) I kept what I liked, returned what did not work, and shopped again. I like having this option, however I would not like abuse this policy, so I try to be fairly certain I want a product before buying, but the security of knowing you are not wasting your money if it doesn't work out makes me more likely to treat myself to a higher end product that I might otherwise pass over. \n\nOne downside to this location is that they do not carry MAC cosmetics, but the Cascade Station and Jantzen Beach locations do and are not too far away.

I frequent this Ulta, because I work close by and it's convient, but it's far from a good place to shop,companies to my wxpirence at other Ultas. Typically the employees are all standing around chatting, they hardly ask if you need help, and when they do, or you finally track someone down, they wave you in the general direction on what your looking for, but never take you there. If your shopping on the right side of the store (the not high end makeup) they will hardly look your direction. I stood in line one time, while there was a customer at the one register that was open. Then a manager I assume, rang up and employee on a different register that was in front of me. While I was waiting to still be checked out the manager, went back to her group of employees, chatted it up for a few then when she realized that the one register transaction was taking a while, she came back over to ring me up. I was in line so long I almost put my stuff down and left. I was the only person in line and that lady could have clearly taken the 10 sec to ring up my one item and then finish her conversation. \nAnother time I was shopping for a new fragrance and a very helpful clique lady helped me narrow it down to 2. I really wanted the opinion of my husband and asked if they had the sample bottles to take home. They didn't have them, and she understood I just wanted my hubs to smell them so she suggested I buy the roller balls and take them home to find out. So when I made my choice I returned the roller balls, that had not been used, but only smelled and that same manger, gave me to worst attitude ever, as though I was a criminal. I was within ultas return policy so if she was upset about the used or damaged product then she needs to get some sample bottles in the store. \nAnd lastly for now because there're many more. I search the shampoo for my regular Treseme because they had a deal going on, when I couldn't find what I was looking for I spent 5 min looking for an employee, who then said to me they keep the \"cheap\" stuff on this section.

I was so thrilled that when my teenaged son's optometrist felt he might have glaucoma and wanted us to follow up with a pediatric ophthalmologist, and that it was important, I naturally called this place. The quickest appointment I could get was in Waltham with Dr. Yang. He did an eye exam (which my son had just had - that's why there was a medical referral). I told the young lady at the checkin they needed to put it through our insurance - and we \"self pay\" the \"insured\" amount. She checked with billing, made sure they had our insurance info, and said it would be $100 (Boston was $35 for a medical eval). There was some discussion about it, but I paid, because my son needed to be seen right away. After a wait (long lines there - not even sitting room for everyone!). Dr. Yang did an exam, and when I asked him about the medical evaluation, he said he only did an exam, and grinning, said it was a very good exam. I asked the young lady when I checked out the appointment was supposed to be for a medical evaluation. She said that was up to the doctor. A few weeks later I received an additonal bill for $135. So I called again and asked why I was told $100. She said that was for people without insurance. But they knew we had insurance and they checked with billing AND our insurance co. at the time the $100 was charged.

I was looking for a pulmonologist  and I called this office to see if one of the many lung docs there would see me. So I called and spoke to Stephanie in the front office and specifically asked her if they accepted United Healthcare Community Care. She said yes but in order for me to see them I would have to have my records faxed over to them and I would have to get a referral. Which was not a problem. So I called my lung doc's office and told them to fax my records to this office and that I would no longer see him. The lady said that was fine and faxed them over. So when this office received them she called me and said they got them and set an appointment for me to see Dr.Mark Clark. She called a couple of days later needing more information and she asked me again what insurance did I have again. I told her United Healthcare Community plan. Well the next morning she called me back saying they ran my insurance and that they didn't accept it. \n\nSo I said why would you tell me you accept it when you don't and she said \"well you said you had United Healthcare\" and I said yeah I said United Healthcare COMMUNITY plan. Then she got quiet for a bit and then said well let me transfer you to the business office. Nobody answered and she said she would walk over there, see if they were there, and have them call me back. Of course I never got that call back so I called them Monday and spoke to a lady in the business office and told her what happened. She said she would take a message and my info and give it to the manager because I said I wanted to file a complaint. So the manager called me later on that day and said she called my rheumatologist and my pulmonologist's offices to ask if they had referred me to those offices and they told her no naturally. Of course they didn't refer me I found them on my own, did what I was told by their front office lady, and told my rheumatologist to fax over a referral to see a doc there. Which there is no law that states you can't find doctors on your own. Which was what I told her. And I also told her I did not appreciate being mislead and given the wrong information because due to that I got screwed because I listened to Stephanie and then told my lung doc I no longer wanted to see him. \n\nTo which she kept telling me no I wasn't mislead. So after 5 or so minutes of going back and fourth over being mislead I brought up a scenario for the idiot manager and said If I tell you we're going to hang out tonight and that I'm going to pick you up and I never pick you up and we don't hang out is that not misleading you. And she replied well I'm not going to argue with you and you are wrong and I finally got tired of her and her shenanigans said no ma'am I am right and hung the phone up on her. It's funny because she admitted to me earlier that they make mistakes and they are not perfect so right then and there she admitted to me that they screwed up and yes I was mislead. Either I am GLAD they do not accept my insurance. That manager was so rude and nasty and blatantly lied and did not want to admit their office screwed by giving me the wrong information and basically MISLEADING me which was what they did. Anybody thinking of going to them BEWARE of these fraudulent LIARS! Because of their incompetence I am without a pulmonologist. And by the way I have an autoimmune disease and my insurance will give them an out of network authorization so they would have gotten paid for my visits. Which was what I told the manager but of course she kept changing the subject to well you have to go your insurance and they will find someone for you and they won't pay us.

The appointment was scheduled to take place on the day of the event, four hours prior to its 6:30 PM start time. However, my daughter received a call from the store at 9:00 AM on the day of the event, claiming that there would be no one available to complete her makeup application appointment. Mind you, the store doesn't open until 10:00 AM so I'm guessing this call to my daughter was made as soon as the staff came into the store, which implies that no calls were made to get some other staff member in for my daughter's appointment.\n\nWhat alternatives was my daughter given? Here they are:\n1) Move the appointment to 5:00 PM (I guess someone would have been available then but this was WAY to close to the scheduled start time of the event and, therefore, not an acceptable option).\n2) Come in at the scheduled time for her original appointment and have someone perform her makeup application at the store's Brow Bar where - get this - she would HAVE TO purchase $40 worth of product! What kind of scam is this?!?! Forcing a service appointment cancellation and then providing an \"option\" that forces a customer to have to purchase store product?!?! No way!\n\nThis store is the absolute worst!! Go somewhere else for any beauty-related products and services!!\n\n***Poster's Editorial: If anyone is wondering what happened with my daughter, thankfully I was able to schedule an appointment for her at the Ulta location in Waterford Lakes, which both her and my wife absolutely loved since they took great care of her there! I'll be posting an exact opposite review of this post regarding the Waterford Lakes location.***", "date": "2017-05-21 20:48:17"}, {"review_id": "SrILhka67EgtDgM6frzS1g", "user_id": "J6v7mLk7x4-4F3BgAwY7uw", "business_id": "x2-Ndd-JanynbcVvaLXQGQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I absolutely love the doctors here and that is the only reason I stay.

The only   Reason I was is because I didn't wanna be delayed because my mom was watching my son.\n\nI waited in the car and went back in at 1:45 and she was still blow drying the other customers hair and not even looking at me. So manager Michelle comes up to me apologizing, thinking okay she's apologizing for the issue that's nice. NO. \nMichelle tells me she tried calling me just now to tell me there was a issue with the system and my name got booted out. I told her yeah but Betty said she'll do my hair. Betty was pretending I never talked to her. \nSo I tell her the inconvenience it would be if it's any later but it's fine and she tells me, \"Unfortunate for YOU but we have other clients coming in, okay?\" At that point I'm furious at what she said. So I told her, \"Since your admitting it's your fault and it's on your guys end the same way yous delayed my day and told me to come back and moved it up why can't you guys move up the other clients or call them like you guys should've called me yesterday or earlier today and do my hair like you guys said yous would since I made my appointment first?\" But I'm the nicest way I could have said it. \nShe tells me, \"Haha, no, no, I'm sorry but we can't do that to them they have appointments.\"\n\nSoooo I decided to ask her what time did she wanna see me then and omg lol she tells me, \"Oh not today another day next week.\" \nI said Oh really? \n\"Yeah, unfortunately for you they have appointments and we can't see you today.\"\nMeanwhile Betty is pretending I'm not even there. The whole store is looking at me and this manager is speaking over me the whole time and shaking her head and rolling her eyes. \n\nSo while walking out I asked a employee for the store manager and if Michelle was her and she said no the main managers aren't in and on vacation. \nSo Michelle feels while she's in charge she can treat people like crap.

Sorry for the length. I've been coming to this store for a while and loved it. But I finally decided to try the salon for a new color. My experience was so bad that I don't think I can even go back to this location for the store now. I brought in several pictures of the caramel color I wanted and the stylist looked at them for several minutes and even asked several questions about exactly the right caramel shade I wanted and how I wanted the highlights to blend and said that she could do it... so, fast forward 5 whole hours later... Idk how I wound up with the hideous ashy (almost green)  highlights that were not blended AT ALL. The bleached hair went in a blunt straight line across the middle of my head unlike the baylage we discussed which is supposed to fade into the lighter shade.... my blowout was horrible too. It was a frizzy barely straingtened mess (I have naturally curly hair). I was too embarrassed to even go back out in public after I got home. So I had to call out of work the next day to have a manager here fix my color (I was told she wasnt available after I got out of work and that she was the only one allowed to fix it). She agreed it was not at all what I had asked for, based both on the pictures and on what the other stylists who were there when I got it done the day before heard and saw. She was able to blend the highlights a bit better. But I was still left with an ash blonde instead of a caramel blonde and Ive never liked cool ash tones on myself. But she tried convincing me it was caramel now and had several other employees come over and agree that it was a caramel too and praise how great it was fixed. So at that point I just figured id deal with an ash tone and get out of there since it was atleast blended. But then I went to the front of the store to buy some items and they must not have known I was still there because after i walked away from the group of stylists who had JUST told me it looked caramel now, i heard them all discussing how they all knew it was CLEARLY an ash shade still and NOT caramel like I had asked for. I heard the manager telling them that she couldnt get the cool ash tones out though and didnt know what the previous stylist even did to my hair. \nIts bad enough they messed up my hair. But then they tried lying to me and THEN talked amongst eachother about how they lied to me... while i was still in earshot....\nHorrible mistake going to this salon. I saw a woman leave with a nice color done by another stylist (who was also one of the stylists who joined in on lying to me about the tone) but obviously theyre not all at the same talent level and even the manager didnt know how to fix the other stylists mistakes. Dont even take the chance going here. Even if you luck out and get a good stylist, you cant trust them because they apparently will lie to you to keep you from complaining and then act unprofessional by talking about you in the middle of the salon once you walk away.", "date": "2018-06-05 01:51:53"}, {"review_id": "W2yWeJfnsgRMNvXs8xwIpw", "user_id": "4NBnhyUapskGdtshmUC9Rg", "business_id": "X_L1rAJQqAX5tWYXcDhF4g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Have had my hair cut here twice and brought my mother in too.

This location is by far the worst one I have been to and unfortunately is now the closest one to me since I moved. The store is messy. Checking out is extremely slow because they have very little cashiers and long lines. I have been to the store several times where the product I was buying has a free gift offer.

It's like they just try to avoid giving out what they advertised. They go to get the gift and of course, they are out. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I understand that its while supplies last, etc... but I go in there a lot and they never have what was advertised. If this is the case, they need to stop advertising free gifts or order enough for what they have to sell.

They also act like it's an act of congress if you want to use your points or a coupon. But you know they have a smile on their face when they offer that credit card.

He apparently does not think that he is accountable to his customers, and can treat them and/or their reviews of his establishment with blatant disregard.\n\nI ordered lunch from this establishment for a meeting in my office. However, we were overcharged by almost $100 for our order. When I called to inquire about the difference in price (what it CLEARLY states on the available menu on their website vs. what we were actually charged) the gentleman I spoke with on the phone was rude, abrasive and acted as if I was wasting his very precious time. I asked him to email me an itemized receipt and his response was that he \"[didn't] have time for this\" and that my email address was \"too long\".\nOnce I finally got a copy of said itemized receipt, not only had I been overcharged by roughly $10 per item we ordered, HIS math was totally wrong. (I did not have the chance to mention this to the gentleman on the phone, either.) I called again to discuss the overcharging, and was told that I would get a discount of 15% the next time I ordered. I said that we may not order again, as we have no way of knowing what we will actually be charged. I was then told I could have a discount of 30%. I repeated myself. I was told someone would call me back later that day.\nGuess what? No one called me back.\nI called again this morning, and I was basically screamed at that there was a refund sent to my credit card - one I was not made aware of - and when I asked to clarify that the refund was made on the credit card and not just a \"credit\" for my next order, I was told that the next time I ordered, I could not only get free food, but I could also get the keys to the store - an offer I may very well accept, seeing that the food was pretty good, and if we could just do something about the service...\nLong story short - save your money and the headache it is to deal with the owner.

I was amazed by Bob's speed at getting the inspection report to us, he was in the neighborhood, so it was actually hand delivered.  If you look at Bob's site, his sample report is a good example, but you should know that he apprends photos to the end of the report, which I think are very helpful.\n\nAnother thing that really impressed me was that when I called Bob I inquired about Radon testing, he described the process and said he would bring a test kit, but he wanted to wait until the end of the inspection for my decision.  His reasoning was that if there was some major issue that would discourage us from buying the property, he didn't want to charge us for an unecessary test. At the end of the inspection he asked if I wanted to go through with the radon test, we did go with the test (Bob's price for this was also very reasonable), and we found that we did have slightly elevated radon levels.\n\nIn the end, not only do we have a great record of the issues that need to be addressed, but we were able to negotiate on the issues identified.", "date": "2012-03-03 04:17:37"}, {"review_id": "KR45qJUAb_vkMk3w0T3rYA", "user_id": "K-5ueR-jyoG8sxAEFf7XcA", "business_id": "3L0qhi492FU767rRJx7trA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So first of all I would like to say that all of these negative reviews absolutely we're not true with my visit today.

She was amazing.... from start to finish she took excellent care of me she allowed me to express my concerns about my hair. She was so professional during the consultation and gave me different options to how to fix and correct my mess up with my color. The entire time she continued to ask me if I was doing okay if I was feeling any uncomfortableness with the dye she gave me a water bottle she just went above and beyond I felt like. I would totally recommend this place to come and get your hair done they treat you like a queen and it was awesome. After I finish getting my hair done I decided to browse the aisles for a eyebrow kit and the lovely lady up front at the register was nice enough to guide me in the right direction and kind of briefly explain to me about what I should purchase or what I should look into. I had such a great experience I called all of my girlfriends and told them that this Ulta was amazing.

My disappointment with Ulta Beauty is their dinosaur POS  system that doesn't allow your former transactions to be found with your credit or debit cards which is a nightmare if you lost your transaction receipts for any returns or exchanges. \nAlso, giving your phone number at the time of purchase does not guarantee that your purchases will be found. So that continues into my biggest disappointment with Ulta Beauty in that if you don't have a receipt for any exchanges then your purchase item will be returned at a huge percentage off which they state is the lowest selling price. But ask yourself when is the last time you've seen a sale on returned items or any makeup for up to 90% off? They don't sell that at all.

When you get tired of breathing all that obnoxious oxygen and you need  your hookah fix: enter Sultan Hookah Lounge.\n\nThe way this place was described to me by a student at Reed: \"Man, this place is awesome. Great hookah flavors, lots of stuff nearby to walk to, and really chill people here.\"\n\nItem one - this place is awesome. \nI disagree. In Colorado Springs I found a truly epic hookah place. This was more of a run of the mill place to come because it is the only thing open at the time you decide you need some hookah. That levels it down to the last page of your little black book - you know you are going to make that phone call at 1am after you've had a few [too many,] but you still think there was a better option somewhere along the road. Consult item three for a further critique of this place and more reasons why it is not awesome.\n\nItem two - great hookah flavors.\nYes. I agree! We went with three flavors - \"Adios M#**&$*#%\" which was a very interesting taste, but not very strong at all; \"Guava\" which was my favorite and definitely the strongest; and \"Strawberry and Berry mix\" which was not very strong or very awesome, but still acceptable as things go, which it went this time by just smoking this one along with another one at the same time.\n\nItem three - lots of stuff nearby to walk to.\nEh, not so much. The owner himself even said so. Which kind of sucked since most of the group was starving and Taco Bell just seemed like a bad idea. The owner was cool to tell us we could bring anything we wanted back into the place, but with the stunning endorsement of what was available, we decided to just keep smoking and looking at the weird yet awesome videos playing on the television screen. This of course, after the owner initially was acting like a dick and wanted to keep charging and charging and charging - so perhaps the \"nothing good around here\" should be taken with a grain of salt, as the owner becomes much more likeable the longer you spend in the hookah bar.\n\nItem four - totally chill people here.\nNot really. This is not what I had in mind for Portland - it was small; the fellow Hookah bar patrons were extremely unfriendly; some d-bag had his polo collar popped; the owner was initially very friendly and standoffish .... yet the experience was not a total wash.

Though this review is mostly for The Salon, I will mention thoughts on the store too. \n\nI went in for a hair cut and style and was matched up with Brittany. She did a lovely job and most sacredly: She did NOT try to cut off all my long hair! I had heard horror stories about ladies wanting to keep their hair long, would end up with a stylist who would keep chopping until none was left. \n\nNot so with Brittany! She listened to me and showed me exactly how much she would take off. She even massaged my scalp nicely during my shampoo and deep conditioning treatment. I am VERY pleased with my hair and love how soft and silky it feels now about a week later!\n\nI also had an appointment with Tracy to do my makeup. Since it was my birthday, my husband said I could treat myself before we went to dinner. Tracy is pretty damn awesome to talk to! I loved how as she was applying the different steps, she also told me a few tips about how to better manage my skin. Since I was having issues with skin dryness and dullness, she recommended I up my skin exfoliation regime and possibly try out a different product. She wasn't pushing product either though whatever stuff she was using on my face then felt AMAZING!\n\nThe store itself? It seemed pretty typical of all the other Ultas I've been too. This store was clean, well lit, and I had nice interactions with the sales reps I met. \n\nSince I can't give a more complete review about the store, I will leave it at a very solid 4 star review.

I love ulta the store, really really love it. And I have had some nice experiences there, too, which is why this is not getting one star. But after the last visit to the hair salon, I am so incredibly disheartened that I have not been back since. My daughters went in for a cut and blow dry. They were scheduled one after the other, near the end of a day. It was all a bit strange, because the cuts were not as cute as I remembered in the past. In fact, I couldn't see any discernible difference from when they went into the salon (they have pretty hair, but it needed a trim.) \n\nAs we were about to pay, the hairdresser, who in the past had been nice enough, began to complain. A lot. \n\nShe argued that there was no way my daughter could be 12, even she and my daughter had had a long discussion about 6th grade, that my daughter was a millennium, dragon-year baby, etc. Hello? November 2000 to early 2013? Math?\n\nWe had been regular customers, and I had always tipped her very well (20-25%), but she snapped, or something. I was so shocked and appalled when she kept adding on charges at the end. She informed me that she is a \"master hairstylist\", which means an \"upgrade\" (extra $$), that we have to pay extra \"for density\" (we have relatively thick hair, mine the worst--but never in my near 50 years have I EVER heard of this!), and as I said, arguing about age. \n\nThe stylist was so mean about it that my older daughter almost started crying--I think she saw the shock on my face as the bill was presented for twice what I had expected. \n\nSure I paid. Of course. \n\nBut today we just got a note from Ulta's salon, saying \"We Miss You\". \n\nGuess what? We will continue to buy cheap nail polish and heads for the Clarisonic. But we'll never, ever, visit your salon again. Sorry. No one deserves to be treated like a piece of trash. And your stylist made us all feel that way just because we have a lot of hair. So sorry to waste your time with our thick hair and a desire to look good.

If I'm going to Ulta, I am almost always at the location at Cedar Hills. But I made an online order and had to return a few things and my friend was heading in this direction anyways so I was like, why not? Big mistake. First of all, there was a HUGE line for the cash register, and only 1 person was ringing. What is up with that?? Well anyways, the girl who was ringing was taking a long time with the transaction so 2 other people ended up hopping on to the registers after a while. I patiently waited my turn and when it was finally my turn, an older woman was ringing me up. I told her I needed to make a return and it was fine up to this point.\nBut then, she had no idea what she was doing and I was just awkwardly standing there as she tried to figure out this return. I had bought several lip products, two formulas, just various shades. I tried one of each formula but didn't like how they felt. I also bought 2 drugstore eye palettes that I was going to give as gifts but decided against it so they were unused and I was returning those as well. She had to keep asking another cashier for help with the return. When she finally figured it out, she couldn't find the name of the product anywhere and I had to help her out to find it. Then she asked me if any of it was used. I told her that two of the products were used but the rest were not. She then sighs and tells me in a really snooty voice, \"you know, if you use a product, we have to throw it away. That's why we have testers. Next time, you should come into the store and test it out before buying.\" I was kind of... miffed. Because that was total bull. For most drugstore brands, there are NEVER any testers. Half the time, I find products that are for sale, opened up and used. If they had testers for the products that I was returning, I would have tested them out in the first place, rather than creating a headache for everybody by returning things I won't use! And she kept messing up by scanning the wrong item and then clicking her teeth like it was somehow MY fault that she was scanning the same item twice.\nWhen she finally finished scanning everything, she looked at the item that I was going to buy as well and then tried to get someone else to ring me up... for a single item. Then the other cashier tells her than she can scan the item I'm purchasing, rather than having it be a separate transaction from my return. She sighs and does exactly that and then we are finally done. She tells me the return will show up on my card soon.\n\nFor me, this was really stressful and I disliked how the cashier was rude and kept belittling me. Look, I shop for makeup a lot and I buy multiple shades of the same item if I think I'm going to like it. But it didn't work out and I only used one of the 7 shades I had purchased. The others were completely new. This store didn't have testers for the items that I had purchased so they really had to right to tell me that they have testers and I should come into a store, where I was not treated very well, and try those products out beforehand. If there had been testers, I would have used them. So the customer service paired with the employee who had no idea what she was doing, I have to say I'm majorly disappointed.

Fine, I understand they just went through the holidays and might be shopped over.\n\nWhat I really had an issue with was how the staff treated us as we tried to do a return. Our Clarisonic Mia just stoped working- it wouldn't charge, turn on, etc. However, we understood there was an extended warranted on the item, so we just wanted to return it. Unfortunately, we had passed the 60 day return policy that Ulta has, so our only option was store credit (even though, had we contacted Clarisonic directly, we could have gotten a full refund). Since we didn't want to walk out with store credit, we decided to just get a replacement Mia. However, the item had gone up in price by $30 since we last bought it (same exact item, 3 months later). We asked for a direct exchange and were told that the return had already gone through, so there was no way to credit the additional $30. The whole time, instead of offering any type of help at ALL, the cashier literally couldn't have cared less about how frustrating the process was, and blamed everything on either a company policy or a system issue. So basically, because the Clarisonic we bought for $200 broke (after 3 months of use), we were forced into buying it again at Ulta for $30 more (or leaving with $200 of store credit).

I have to agree with the other reviews in regard to the customer service. The staff seems to be a little preoccupied with their own makeup regimen than helping others figure out their own. I had a particular question and after a distracted answer followed by several mirror looks, I opted to walk away and venture on my own. \n\nI do enjoy that Ulta keeps track of your points and gives you discounts. On my most recent trip they had a deal on their own Ulta makeup products. I have to admit, it got me. It got me good. I created my own lip kit (liner, gloss, and lipstick) for about twenty bucks and received a free gift with purchase. The gift was a makeup bag packed with a bunch of Ulta beauty products. The value of the bag itself was around $80 and I was happy to try their products over the most expensive brands. \n\nThe checkout line went fast and the lady manning the register was friendly and got me taken care of quickly. Based on the reviews, I'll likely steer clear of getting services done here, which I wouldn't normally do in a beauty store to begin with. However, I'll definitely be back to grab my goods.

I was deceived by the Yelp reviews, which were the reason that I initially chose him for my home inspection. I regret the decision because it ended up costing me more in repairs than I could have anticipated.\n\nWhy was Bob such a waste of money? Let me explain.\n\n1. He misses BIG problems. There was a hole in the roof of the home we bought. Bob failed to notice it. The roofer who went to fix it showed me a picture. It was so obvious that I think a 5 year old child would have seen it. Of course, Bob was not liable for this issue, and so it was an added expense for me to fix after Bob claimed that the roof was in excellent shape.\n\n2. When you ask him any question about the home inspection, he will embarrass you when you are asking the question. For example, I asked him about the heat pump system. I did not understand it (I am a first time home buyer), and instead of patiently explaining how it works and how it might break, he laughed that I would consider buying a house without knowing what it was... and then didn't say anything else.\n\n3. Heaven forbid that you notice Bob missed something. Like, say, whether or not the dishwasher works. And if you happen to tell him after he has left the kitchen area, he will act like he was planning on walking back to the kitchen, and tell you \"not to do [his] job.\" Sorry Bob, but I kind of assumed you were done with the kitchen once you turned off the light and walked into the bedroom.\n\n4. His reports all seem to suggest that he spends 2+ hours on a condo, and 3.5+ hours on a home. However, the reality is that about 30 minutes of that time is actually spent chatting with the seller's agent. It's like he was trying to drum up business. During our inspection, he literally talked to the agent about his experience as a home inspector and how his past clients all liked him. Umm, sorry Bob, but I'm the one paying for you for your time, not the seller's agent.\n\nPlease do not make the same mistake that I did by having REC Consultants come inspect the house.

I don't care what they pay her now; she deserves more for how well she handles all sorts of inquiries and expertly guides incoming patients to where they need to be. The check-in staff was also great. Overall the front line administrative staff are doing a lot to make patients' experiences positive.\n\nDoctors:\nI saw two doctors during my appointment. Both had excellent \"bedside\" manners and explained the procedures that they were performing as they conducted those procedures. Some of the equipment that they used on my eyes looked pretty intimidating, so the calm narration of what they were doing/why they were doing it/what I could expect to feel was really helpful. I also appreciated that the doctor offered to write up the results of the tests and send it to my regular optometrist; sometimes doctors will just tell you the information and let you bring that info to your regular person (and there's always something that gets lost in translation).\n\nOffice Layout:\nThe layout is well-done. Upon entry you arrive at the receptionist's desk, and can be pointed to the check-in windows (assuming you are there for an appointment). From the check-in windows you have only a short walk to your waiting area, and the examination rooms are all within several feet of that waiting area. Finally, a doctor's office that isn't a maze!

Dr Rapoza was a very nice, charming guy whom I felt very comfortable with.  My biggest and only complaint about the procedure was the over three and a half hour wait before even being called in for prep.  My appt was for 1:30 PM.  I didn't get called in until 4:45 PM.  My ride home had already shown up and had to spends those useless hours with me.  Needless to say I was furious.  Not the kind of mood you want to be in just beofre surgery.  I mentioned the long wait as constructive feedback, to Dr Rapoza at my first follow-up appointment.  He laughed it off and dismissed it as a scheduling snafu.  No acknowledgement, no apology.\n\nDr. Rapoza told me upfront, that cataract surgery on someone who is still relatively young, could result in a subsequent blurring of vision.  Opaqification of the Posterior Capsule was the official term.  The remedy for this would be a simple laser procedure.  A couple of zaps and I would be fine.\n\nFast forward to this past Monday when I was scheduled to have this laser procedure known as a YAG at 2:30 PM in OCB's Waltham office.  I checked in and was brought to the procedure room.  And then left there for over an hour.  By 3:35 PM I was sick of waiting and headed toward the reception desk to reschedule.  Dr Rapoza came thru a door, caught me in the hall and ushered me back to the procedure room.  No acknowledgement of the long wait and no apology.  Sixty seconds later, the procedure was done and he asked me to sit for ten minutes before I left.  I waitd the ten minutes, then went home.\n\nAt about 5:15 PM, my eye started to feel scratchy and irrirtated. I guessed this was to be expected.  It got progressively worse and worse until the pain was unbearable and my eye was blood red and weeping.  When I speak of unbearable pain, take it from someone who has had several episodes of kidney stones.  This pain was worse.  Conviced that something was wrong, at 5:45 PM, I called OCB's 800 number and the answering service took my info and said they would page the opthamologist on call.  After about 15 minutes, I took two Tylenol, put a cold cloth on my eye and reclined on the sofa to wait for the phone call.  I drifted off to sleep and awoke at 7:45 PM, two hours later.  The pain was still intense an no one had called me back.  The phone was right next to my head.  I would have heard it.  I even checked my caller ID device.  No call had been made.  I called the answering service again and explained the situation.  They said they would page the doctor again.\n\nA little after 8:00, a woman called me back explaining that she was the OCB doctor on call.  I immediately told her that I had called two and a half hours prior.  She huffingly explained that she received no prior page.  She then went on to tell me that after a laser procedure, \"some discomfort isto be expected\".  I told her that the pain was and had been extreme.  Her response was that it was \"no big deal\" and that I was \"fine\".  She seemed quite put out to have been bothered in this fashion and couldn't wait to get off the phone.  I told her it was unacceptable to not have an emergency call returned.  She replied that she had just received the page and \"now I've called you back\".  In other words, I've covered my ass.  I was so angry, I informed her that OCB and Dr Rapoza had just lost a patient and hung up.  She never asked me what my symptoms were.  Never asked me about the pain or level of pain.  Never asked me what the eye lookedlike or how my vision was.  Nice.\n\nMuch later that night, I sent a very angry email via the OCB website.  Two days later, OCB's Compliance Officer called me offering all manner of emapthy and apologies.  She explained that the answering service had been at fault for the first page not being sent to the doctor on call.  She also admitted after hearing my version of events, that the woman who called me back had handled my call completley inappropriately, that I was not triaged correctly and that OCB had completely failed me.  She wanted me to come back in to hve my eye checked.  I declined saying I longer trusted anyone at OCB.  She advised me to get checked out elsewhere, which I did.  During the course of our conversation, she also informed me that their doctors on call were \"fellows\" who were only with OCB for a few months at a time.  She informed me that this \"fellow\" (i.e., student, intern, trainee...) would be reported to the attending physician.  And that was the end of it.  No apology or even a phone call from Dr Rapoza.

I called the doctor's assistant, who is never available when I call and left a message (two days ago).  No response.  I called again today, and she was again not available, so I asked to speak to someone else and was referred to another assistant, who did not even speak with me.

I had a rather negative experience last week.  I went in for my second cut and style with a male stylist there.  The first time I was a little worried as I have very thick, wavy hair and he blunt cut it with scissors, no razoring or thinning....but somehow it worked out after I styled it and trimmed it a bit myself.  This time, it was a disaster.  I loved my hairstyle and I told him that I just needed it cleaned up a bit but I wanted to keep growing it out.  I should mention that I moved my appointment up over an hour so my stylist could be done early that night.  Cool if he gets to go home early, but this led to the feeling of being very rushed.  Especially since one of the first things he said to me was that he got to go home after he finished with me.  Anyway, after the wash, he began the cut.  Nothing inherently wrong there except his continuous use of profanity and even going so far as to quietly talk crap about the client in the chair across from us because she was telling a very long story.  I mean, I don't care about the occasional curse but this is a professional environment, not a bar, and it was not occasional.  Oh yea, and I part my hair on the left.  He parted it right in the middle and proceeded to cut it....if you know anything about cutting, it makes a huge difference, especially with hair like mine.\n\nSo after he cut me, he started to blow dry me straight with a round brush.  The last time he cut my hair, it turned out pretty nice like that.  My hair is chin length, it wouldn't have taken that long but I guess it was for him so he continued to blow dry it without the brush and then wanted to follow up with straightening it on top but round brush straightening it on the bottom stating once it was \"the best of both worlds.\"  By the time he was done, it was huge.  It had this bizarre round mushroom shape.  When he spun me around I was kind of shocked that he was done.  He didn't ask me to feel it for weight, he didn't check to make sure the sides were even, nothing.  He created this terrible mushroom haircut, took no weight out and sent me on my way.  As he was taking off my cape, I said \"it's kind of big....\"  and he just chuckled and said it looked great.  Then he walked over to wait for me by the cash register as I gathered my things.  I know you're thinking, \"Why didn't you tell him to fix it?\" and I guess I should have spoken up louder but I honestly did not feel like he wanted to hear it.  It was so weird.  I usually have my stylist asking me if I like it, is there anything that needs to be fixed, to call if I need anything or notice any parts acting weird.  I just felt like he was trying to shoo me out as quickly as possible.  When i got home, it was clear that the right side was significantly different than the left.  There was a good .5\" - 1\" of length difference and the bulkiness was unmanageable.  I ended up having to go to my friend's stylist and getting a completely different cut.  I have NEVER been one to skimp on a haircut.  It's worth the money to go somewhere and get it done right.  I'm sorry Ulta....this is one area that you need to coach your employees on simple customer service and technical cutting skills.

I couldn't be happier. Laura listened to what I wanted, didn't try and up-sell me after I was in the chair.

I work at MGH and therefore was relieved at its proximity to my office.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place, and I feel it would be remiss of me to not offer this review to others interested.\nFirst: I had my first appointment and I had to wait around 45 minutes to be seen for a routine contact lens appointment.  The receptionist had a very wooden personality and made me wonder if she was a cylon (and I have never seen Battlestar Gallactica).  The doctor seemed like a good guy, but was a bit odd, kept saying things like \"Yeah, I get ya\" or \"That makes sense\" to the extent that it was awkward as if he was just flipping through responses that had little to do with what I was talking about.  That's fine, honestly- it really didn't affect my opinion.  What took place after the appointment is really what I want to talk about.\nFirst, this place is a do-everything eye place.  That means that if you are like me, just getting a prescription renewed (not even changed) so you can buy more contacts, then good luck.  I had to wait behind a very angry woman who bought glasses, then had eye surgery, and then wanted new glasses for free because she had the surgery.  I felt bad for the receptionist- it was terrible.  Mainly because there were 4 or so other senior citizens who did not have to have a job to get back to.  One even cut me.  \"No big deal,\" I thought, there are 3 receptionists.  Well 1 was doing paperwork and couldn't be bothered, except to chime in with the woman arguing with the first receptionist.  The other woman, Ms. Wooden, knew that all she had to do was pick up my prescription from the printer tray and take my $15 copayment.  Instead, I had no idea what she was doing- but certainly not a customer first attitude.  Even that's fine.  Not a 5 star review, but I will get over it.\nI left, and emailed the place twice or thrice over a 2 week time trying to order contacts from their shop.  I got a response after the third saying they would forward the information to the optical department.  Almost a week later I got a voicemail from another woman.  I had to start completely over (they don't take notes?).  Fine.  So instead of spending all my working hours trying to get into contact with these guys, I decided to walk in.  I come in the office after explaining my insurance and what I want, blah blah blah.  Still, had to start over and explain.\nShe told me the cost.  No- clearly forgot again about my insurance.  Put in some numbers and gave me another cost (too high).  No.  I told her my plan, she said she would check with Davis and get back to me.\nShe didn't.  Okay, 2 star review.  2 days ago I ordered my contacts from 1800contacts.com because clearly these people did not want my business.  So I get a voicemail yesterday saying that my 1800contacts order was cancelled because my prescription apparently expired.  Okay, 1 star.  Today is 13 September, my appointment was 13 August.  You couldn't figure that out?  Honestly, this could not have been more routine and ended up being VERY annoying.  I do not recommend.\n\nUPDATE!!! About 3 weeks after I order my contacts from 1800contacts, I get a call from the office saying that my contact order is in.  Okay?  So then I get a letter about a week and a half later from my insurance saying that they will not reimburse me because my allowance has already been used.  By who, you ask?  These jerks.  So now they provide terrible service and then assume I will buy from them after they basically forget about me or bother contacting me.

I know, you're thinking \"why didn't she say anything there?\" I have anxiety issues, and telling her exactly what I wanted was hard enough. Not to mention during the cut I also said some things, all she did was smile and kept doing it. When I called I got ahold of the store manager and she said when I left I was \"happy\" with the service according to what the salon manager said. Apparently the salon manager was at the station next to us. The salon manager obviously was not paying attention, although we did make eye contact when I was about to burst into tears, but me about to cry I guess means I'm happy in their world. My feeling we're dismissed, they didn't care at all. The store manager was rude and kept talking over me when I was expressing my concerns. If the salon manager ever calls me back, I am I have spots missing in my hair, it's not even, it's shorter than I wanted, the layers are choppy and my bangs are a inch long (I have side bangs). I called the store about 30-45 minutes after I left the store and took a good look in the comfort of my own home. I broke down into tears, this is the longest my hair has been in a year, and it was only down to a little past my ears. However, now it's to the middle of my ears! I am so depressed over this, I don't want to even leave the house. They said that the salon manager will call me in a few minutes, but that was an hour ago. She would probably just tell me that my feelings are not valid like the store manager did. I don't advise going to the salon, or having any interactions with either of the managers. Your feelings will be dismissed and your issues won't be valid. \n\n**Update.\nThe manager finally called me back, she was sympathetic, but you can tell it wasn't genuine. She would adjust it for free if it's in the next 7 days, which to be honest, I have bald areas in my hair.. I would have to pretty much cut all my hair off. Then she said she can offer 50% off my next hair appointment that she would do herself. 1. My hair will pretty much have to be cut off entirely if it's in 7 days, at the end of the month it will at least be a tiny bit longer 2. 50% off my next hair cut, they won't even cover a full cut? 3. How could I trust them to even cut my hair again? I barely had any hair and now it looks like I'm going to have to spend another 60$ to another salon to pretty much get it all chopped.\nThis is my worst nightmare, and I won't be leaving my house without a beanie for a long time.", "date": "2020-01-05 02:34:36"}, {"review_id": "lfjfuxTTFVX9O-q0fNt0MA", "user_id": "STh102kWVJW1R0jU55fb-w", "business_id": "mV1fXaRQDszBjSNw3eZHTQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "First time coming here to see Dr. Cruz.

The care I have received at OCB has been world class. As someone with extremely difficult eyes, i know that finding talented and caring professionals is difficult. I have been seen in eye centers all around the northeast and the care I have received from OCB has been fantastic. Dr. Shingleton's group is staffed with top notch doctors who care about their patients. This is a rare combination. This also occurs in an organized and professional office that makes you confident that this is the right place for you. I have been to many practices that lack one or many of these qualities and it creates enough uncertainty that you are uneasy. You only have one set of eyes and you want to trust them to people who you are sure are on top of their profession. This group is that!  My situation called for extremely difficult and somewhat chancy surgery. Other doctors along my journey to find the right place either were uncomfortable in their ability to do the surgery or over confident and dismissive of the concerns. Having a doctor whose ego takes up more of the office than the equipment, is nit the place for me. This practice was really goldilocks. They were confident they could complete the task, but understood and compensated for the risks so that I knew the possibilities and still felt confident in moving forward. From Dr. Shingleton and Kowabata to the resident Dr. Jackson and down to the techs every person treated me with respect and care and made themselves available to me for questions, issues and reinforcement. Dr. Shingleton even consulted when my pressure elevated 2 weeks after surgery while he was on his fishing vacation. Dr. Jackson - the short term resident on staff- took extra time to see me multiple times and to answer every question in exacting and soothing detail. She will have a great career once her residency is complete. Any practice will be lucky to have her. She is extremely thorough, personable, confident and yet deferential to the senior doctors at the practice. Whenever she observed something with my eyes, she would note it, discuss it with me and suggest what was going on. When she then would call in multiple specialists at the practice, they would always concur with her finding without knowing what she had found. She is patient, understanding, explains things at a level that all can understand and has a self- deprecating sense of humor that is at once disarming and comforting. I can't thank them enough for saving my vision and caring about me. If you want a practice that will do right by you and your eyes, this is it. If there is any criticism to be made, it is the larger organizational structure. As any business gets larger, more moving parts can mean communication issues and some inconvenience in getting through the larger corporate web to the people that matter. The office and surgical scheduling communication difficulties, the check in and out can make you feel like you are dealing with the DMV or a large impersonal corporation, but if you keep the bigger picture in mind and realize they need these structures because they have gotten so large because they are so good, you will have the right frame of mind going in.  Despite the feeling of impersonal check in and out, the business end is very efficient. I have a high deductible plan and some practitioners at this level of excellence simply wont deal with insurance. The office support here is so complete, I have not had to deal with my insurance over bills in any of the multiple trips to the office.  I would recommend this practice to anyone, especially those with eyes that others have described as difficult.", "date": "2019-09-27 20:51:15"}, {"review_id": "Piip7ItfrQUDH25VMQXYNg", "user_id": "gRsKrloI3HAnDLZbCCtQsg", "business_id": "iOGSQQlIiwMH6VuZB9U9Og", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Looks to be about 20 people working here and only two registers open and a huge line wrapped around and then there are about 10 workers talking and nobody \"available \"to help me it's fine I can order my stuff from Amazon thanks anyways what a complete waste of my time.\n\nCame again today from ad I got in mail.

I was searching some concealers and the one I picked was out of stock so I asked if they had any more in stock or if it would be easier to just order it online. The worker there was really nice and went back to check and said they were out of stock. I thanked her and said I'd order it online but she insisted that one of the shades that were next to the one I had selected would work for me and wanted to show me that by trying it on my face. I said I was sure I had picked the right shade but if she actually thought the shades would work I would try them. She applied a primer with a small brush under my eyes even though I told her I don't like using primers, which was irritating because I wouldn't be able to see what the concealer would have looked like if I had used it normally. She blended one color under one eye with the same brush she had applied the primer with, then blended the other color under the other eye with the same brush she had just used for both the primer and other color. Neither of the colors were the shade I was looking for but I honestly am not sure if that's because she used the same brush for everything and I couldn't actually tell what the second shade was. I know not everyone uses different brushes for everything but it was counter effective in this situation because it made the swatch a different color. I wasn't expecting very much when I went in the store, but Ulta definitely does push selling products over providing a good experience to their customers. To make things worse, I started to develop an extremely painful stye under the eye that she applied the second color to after the primer and other shade a couple hours after I left the store and it makes me really concerned about the sanitary measures they take, as I had no idea how clean the brush was and the stye leads me to believe that it was not safe to put directly by my eyes.

Which was a total shock -- I basically broke down as soon as we left the office.\n\nI came back a couple of weeks later for more tests and was told that I met the legal definition of blindness in one eye and was one degree off in the other. I talked to her on the phone the following week, and she said she'd shown my charts to her colleagues, and they had  agreed with her diagnosis . She filled out the paperwork for the state commission on the blind and agreed to sign my employer's leave paperwork.

They feature both the high end and the low end of beauty products. This store did just that, but the staff was AWFUL. \n\nI was so excited to find that Boulder valley now had an Ulta, I was living in GA prior and had one near me which I really enjoyed. Friendly staff, great products etc. But something must be wrong with this brand new store. The staff were extremely unprofessional and rude. \nI came in looking for a contouring pallet and was greeted by a tall slim girl with long blonde hair. She seemed to be pretty knowledgable so I asked her if she would use the pallet on me to try it out. She told me numerous times that she \"had no idea what she was doing\" Great start. Then later in the conversation she told me that she was a manager. Seriously? It's your JOB to keep up with the latest beauty products and applications. It ended up looking horrible. As she was (trying to) apply the contour she kept telling me that \"your foundation is soooo not the right color, this is crazy. You really NEED a different color foundation. Girl this is WRONG.\" This may have been true, but the way she told me was extremely rude and judgmental. She should really be retrained or something. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. \n\nAfter the horrible experience in the makeup department, I decided to give It a second chance in the salon. I had a KaraStraight treatment done which turned out nicely but the process was yet another disappointing one. The stylist working on me was quiet but I didn't mind that much. Yet every question I had about the hair treatment I had she returned to her binder because she \"wasn't quite sure \" This was a $175 dollar treatment, so it was very worrisome to me that she knew nothing about it. She did indeed tell me that I needed a special shampoo and conditioner to prolong the treatment. She showed me a few and while I was waiting for the treatment to set I went to the front to purchase. Everything was going alright until it came to the straightening process. She used this seemingly useless straightener that vibrated when she clamped down. She had to go through my whole head of hair and straighten about an inch section at a time. This is extremely painful because each run of the straightener she would pull little strands of my hair!! This was like AN HOUR OF HORRIBLE PAIN!!! And I have a VERY strong scalp! She also touched my ears and forehead with the straighter MULTIPLE TIMES. I was so happy when the process was finally over and all I wanted to do was get out of there. I was about to get up from the stylists chair and she asked me \"can you do me a favor? Can you return that shampoo and RE-PAY for it?? So I can get credit for it??\" I was appalled. First of all, she should of mentioned something MUCH earlier, perhaps when I was picking out the shampoo with her???? And second, this is just horrible customer service. I tentatively agreed to do this. How ridiculous. \nFinally I went up to the register to pay, I waited 5 mins then had to explain to the same cosmetics girl that I had to deal with   earlier, why I needed to return and then re buy the hair products. They made me walk back and forth twice all the way from the register back to the salon TWICE FOR SOME STUPID REASON I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I WAS AGREEING WITH. \n\nAll together my visit was horrible.

I was asked to go to Boston Ultrasound to get checked and the receptionist who notified me didn't indicate anything about what time they close.

It was not like I was late for my hair appointment, the website clearly indicated they are open till 5 pm and there was no indication of summer hours. So, until she called, I was not even aware that they were planning to close at 2 pm and I was causing them delay. This was a very difficult situation for me and all I wanted to do was make sure the baby was ok. Yet, for her and the doctor, I was just someone who was disrupting their plan to leave early on a Friday. As she kept harassing me on and on, and made it clear I can't see the doctor and have to wait till Monday, I had to then directly go to the hospital to get myself checked.

It had been about a year and a half since I saw him (at their old location in Piedmont Hospital). Everything was fine then and I got a new prescription for my eyeglasses (my contacts were OK). \n\nSince my last visit, I had been having a lot of problems with my contact lenses. They were always irritable, I couldn't wear them all day (or some days at all), they made my eyes red, itchy and watery, and they even gave me pink eye. I was sort of avoiding the eye doctor since I was afraid they were going to tell me that I couldn't wear contacts anymore. Before I had these problems, my lenses were so carefree. I have gas permeable (hard) lenses but I loved them because they were so easy to wear and care for. My contact lens issues and the thought of only being able to wear glasses instead of contacts were very upsetting to me. But, finally I couldn't take it any more so I made an appointment. \n\nI got there and I told them my issues, which also included when I took a course of antibiotics that made my eyes extremely light-sensitive and seemed to maybe be when the whole problem started (although I couldn't be sure they were related). Dr. Patorgis checked my eyes out and said they looked healthy but he did see a change in my prescription and he recommended new contact lenses in any case since they may be warped or something, which would cause irritation. \n\nAfter my visit with Dr. Patorgis, I went to pay and he went to talk to the contact lenses department to explain the situation to them and to try to work me in for a visit even though I had no appointment with them that day. I went over to the contact lens department next as he was leaving and he told me that I was all set to have an appointment right then. \n\nAfter waiting just a short time, I went in to see Dr. Arlene. I explained my symptoms to her and she asked a question, and then she said she knew exactly what the problem was. Wow. I asked her to explain and she said she thought I might be allergic to fluoride or fluorine components, which is a component in many RGP lenses. This made complete sense in light of my reaction to the antibiotic which was a fluoroquinolone. This was a great theory but the truth was in the trying of my non-fluoride-containing lenses. \n\nWhen I returned in two days to get my lenses and get them checked out, I was amazed. There was no irritation at all. It was remarkable after the months of fear of putting in my lenses because I knew they'd be tearing up for the first 30 minutes and then I might not even be able to tolerate wearing them. I was so happy. But, add to it that my vision was actually corrected to 20/20 which has NEVER been possible before (it was always 20/25 at best), and this was just the best eye doctor experience ever. When I was driving home, I was intentionally trying to read every sign because I could really read them all! It was awesome. \n\nOverall, the prices were very reasonable for everything. Each doctor here (or cluster of doctors) has a staff that handles their appointments, reception, billing, etc. so when you get here, be sure to look for the signs indicating where your doctor is located. It's a huge office (two floors) so be careful to not get lost. Some staff members were maybe a bit less-than-friendly but I ignored them because the people who really matter here are great.

So I'll just review the 10 minutes I was there.\n\nI was referred to this practice because for no reason, my lips all of the sudden looked like a really really bad version of Lisa Rinna's already bad lips.  Making it worse was the fact that they were peeling and while I never thought lips could hurt, they did.  I called to make my appointment and spoke with an individual at the front desk who was very nice.  I'm not mentioning her name because she WAS nice, but she was obviously misinformed and/or not trained properly.  I told her that my insurance was with Coventry and she said they accepted patients enrolled in the plan.  Just to be sure, I asked her if I should send over my insurance card and she enthusiastically said there was no need.  YES, there was.\n\nI arrived at my appointment to find about 7 women sitting at the front desk.  The \"greeter\" woman was not very good at greeting...didn't say hello, and her smile seemed forced.  I signed in and took a seat along with the 30 or so others who were seated.  It kind of reminded me of the DMV but with nicer carpet and chairs.  No reading material that I could see but I wasn't there long enough to read anyway so I'm not going to include that as a reason for one star.\n\nA few minutes later, the greeter asked me for my driver's license and insurance card.  And a few minutes after that she called my name again and I thought \"Well, this is really moving along!\"  She then told me that they didn't accept my insurance because it was Coventry HMO.  I told her I had specifically asked that question when I called to set the appointment, and that I had even offered to fax over my card so we could avoid exactly what was happening right that minute.  Her response was nothing more than the fake smile and a blank look at me and my lips (which at that point felt like they were on fire).  Apparently thinking that I was desperate to fix my lips, she asked me if I still wanted to keep the appointment.  Uh, no...not if you don't take my insurance!!!\n\nI left the building almost in tears but then remembered that I had called another practice in error about a week prior.  The woman (Fonda) explained that they weren't Dermotology Consultants but that they were right next door and people often confused the two practices.  So I called, Fonda remembered me and invited me to come right over.  Two minutes later I was filling out new patient paperwork.\n\nThat said, I'd like to thank Dermatology Consultants for introducing me to Dermatology Associates of Georgia.

I went to exchange a tube of Benefit mascara because it started clumping up on my eyelashes after just a few uses.  I had bought it just the week before and this is the second time this has happened to me with this brand of mascara.  When I went to the register the lady asked me where the package was that the mascara came in.  I told her that I didn't have it and why would I save the package?  That seemed a little ridiculous because I have no idea something isn't going to work right away and I don't want all the packages laying around in my dressing room.  The girl then looked at my account very slowly to verify that I wasn't lying, which can be done without treating the customer like they are lying.  Anyway, when I saw her scrolling through pages on her register I told her that the mascara that I bought came with a free small mascara....thinking I was helping her. She said Oh, where's the small mascara? btw, the mini mascara was free with purchase.  I was shocked she needed this for the exchange and told her I didn't know I needed to bring it back. By then her Manager came to \"help\" and I was told there was nothing they could do for me no exceptions.  Unbelievable!\nI thought Ulta advertised that if you aren't happy with any product you can return it.   So Im thinking are you freaking kidding me this is the second time this mascara has clumped on my eyelashes after using it just a few times.  Also, ive never returned any of all the expensive creams, concealers, powders, age dying whatever products that I've bought that haven't worked.  I may continue to use the same mascara because I like it that much, but I'll shop at Sephora from now on.

So I went her with my mom and my friend and we were having a fun makeup day. This Ulta is awesome because even though some stuff is pricey, they have a cool selection near the back of the store for less expensive items if your just looking to look around and get a couple things but you don't want to spend your whole wallet. They also usually have really cool sales near the back in the eyeliner selection which is nice. But of course Ulta is a place of makeup and makeup Is expensive that's just the way it is so get used to it. I know that sounds harsh but it's true... but not all makeup, just in general makeup is expensive. Don't worry though they're prices are super reasonable, but like I said if you don't want to spend a bunch and are looking for something less expensive and good quality, they have a cool section for that and not just that, the staff is super nice and will help you. Another great reason I recommend this Ulta is that there store is very organized like I'm taking super organized. The reason I find this organized is because, everything is categorized by brand, price, type of material, type of makeup, weather it's hair or shampoo or cleanser it's all got its special place. Yes when you go near the middle of the store it feels like a maze of makeup and you have to find your way through the isles hahah .... don't worry I'm over exaggerating but the signs, workers, and customer service make it very easy to find your way to what you want. The helpful staff will not stop till they help you find what your looking for, they are extremely nice. Even if your very picky with makeup, you can have a conversation with them and they'll recommend items that work for them on their face and also tell you what's best for your face and your skin type. This lady was very nice she asked me if I needed any help and I said I think I'm good and she said if I ever need anything let her know, she occasionally checked in on my mother, my friend and I to see if we needed anything at all and was making sure that we had a lovely experience at finding what we need when we need it. This is amazing costumer service and it wasn't just her it was the whole staff. Your probably thinking I'm over exaggerating or adding on things to make me sound cool or whatever but nooooo I'm promising you if you go here you will have an AWESOME time too. Haha I know I sound crazy but if your a makeup enthusiast or a makeup geek like me it's a candy store for makeup lovers or like when your a little kid and there's a toy store, you jump up and down with excitement, this is that feeling well at least for me.

Unfortunately, that was the primary reason for my visit.  I spent about 10-20 minutes waiting for her each visit and saw her for less than two minutes each time.  It was alarming how quickly she entered and left.  I also found her to be quite condescending.  I was there for psoriasis-- which they never biopsied to confirm, by the way-- but she spent an odd amount of time saying, \"You look greeeeeat!\" in a really annoying, patronizing way.\n\nShe never explained my skin issues, and any information she offered was because I continued to prod her for it.  I was basically the only one in the room asking any questions at all, which was probably annoying for her.  She seemed like she confidently knew what she was doing.  Once, she looked at a spot on my skin and proclaimed, \"I know what that is!\"  Um... congratulations?  Wanna share?\n\nOverall, my experience with Dr. Juneau was subpar, and she is not a good match for the informed patient who wants to understand the medical issue. I also never received any information about when/how to schedule follow-up appointments.

This store did just that, but the staff was AWFUL. \n\nI was so excited to find that Boulder valley now had an Ulta, I was living in GA prior and had one near me which I really enjoyed. Friendly staff, great products etc. But something must be wrong with this brand new store. The staff were extremely unprofessional and rude. \nI came in looking for a contouring pallet and was greeted by a tall slim girl with long blonde hair. She seemed to be pretty knowledgable so I asked her if she would use the pallet on me to try it out. She told me numerous times that she \"had no idea what she was doing\" Great start. Then later in the conversation she told me that she was a manager. Seriously? It's your JOB to keep up with the latest beauty products and applications. It ended up looking horrible. As she was (trying to) apply the contour she kept telling me that \"your foundation is soooo not the right color, this is crazy. You really NEED a different color foundation. Girl this is WRONG.\" This may have been true, but the way she told me was extremely rude and judgmental. She should really be retrained or something. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. \n\nAfter the horrible experience in the makeup department, I decided to give It a second chance in the salon. I had a KaraStraight treatment done which turned out nicely but the process was yet another disappointing one. The stylist working on me was quiet but I didn't mind that much. Yet every question I had about the hair treatment I had she returned to her binder because she \"wasn't quite sure \" This was a $175 dollar treatment, so it was very worrisome to me that she knew nothing about it. She did indeed tell me that I needed a special shampoo and conditioner to prolong the treatment. She showed me a few and while I was waiting for the treatment to set I went to the front to purchase. Everything was going alright until it came to the straightening process. She used this seemingly useless straightener that vibrated when she clamped down. She had to go through my whole head of hair and straighten about an inch section at a time. This is extremely painful because each run of the straightener she would pull little strands of my hair!! This was like AN HOUR OF HORRIBLE PAIN!!! And I have a VERY strong scalp! She also touched my ears and forehead with the straighter MULTIPLE TIMES. I was so happy when the process was finally over and all I wanted to do was get out of there. I was about to get up from the stylists chair and she asked me \"can you do me a favor? Can you return that shampoo and RE-PAY for it?? So I can get credit for it??\" I was appalled. First of all, she should of mentioned something MUCH earlier, perhaps when I was picking out the shampoo with her???? And second, this is just horrible customer service. I tentatively agreed to do this. How ridiculous. \nFinally I went up to the register to pay, I waited 5 mins then had to explain to the same cosmetics girl that I had to deal with   earlier, why I needed to return and then re buy the hair products. They made me walk back and forth twice all the way from the register back to the salon TWICE FOR SOME STUPID REASON I DONT EVEN KNOW WHY I WAS AGREEING WITH. \n\nAll together my visit was horrible.

I decided last year when I turned 30 that I wanted to stay looking 30 forever! or at least try to anyway.

I went with a vague idea of what I wanted (some kind of laser facials, treatment for KP, potentially botox to prevent sweating on my wedding day?) but I was basically helpless not knowing what would be best for what I was looking for. I dont recommend doing what I did and going straight to the event if you are a newbie because it was super overwhelming. You just line up and buy services for the most part and talk to vendor reps who only know/care about their own product-- I thought I would have been able to have a one on one consult with a Dr but honestly that was my own fault for assuming. I had to hunt down an aesthetic practitioner through the thick crowd to get advice on which of the many service would match what I was looking for and thankfully I got one of the best workers the office has! \nSam recommended a full regimen of laser treatment for the year leading up to my wedding so I look my best (and to kick start the whole 'look 30 forever thing') and was honest about much cheaper/better alternatives to treating my KP and preventing sweating. She is also the one I requested to perform my procedures and so far, so great. \nThe only snafu I have encountered thus far was that, since I was a new customer and had never been evaluated by a Dr at their office, I had to have a brief meeting with a PA right before my 1st facial. No one told me about this prior to me showing up and I didn't realize I would have to pay $130.00 for our brief 5 minute chat. I get it though-- it's and easy mistake for the office to have made since I went about getting my treatments in a non conventional manor.

The City of Cambridge requires a building permit for this type of change though (in a condo w/ 2+ units), which required stamped structural drawings.

Farzam responded to my email inquiry within a few hours, and called me to talk about the changes. He also gave me an estimate over the phone ($2k less than my previous quote), sent me an official invoice, and was able to come out to the condo the NEXT DAY.

On Saturday March 14, I walked into Ulta to ask about a color correction and was assured by Nicole, the salon manager, that Emily would be the best person to assist me. I was advised that due to my length of hair and thickness it would be about $180-$225. Sounded good to me. I never spend much on my hair and figured it would be ok to splurge. I arrived at 11am on 3/30 and was early for my appointment. I heard Emily say she hadn't had coffee. I figured I was early and would go grab her one since she was about to give me the makeover I've been dying for. By the time I left the salon it was 7:20pm, I was hungry, embarrassed as I was sent home looking like a wet dog with samples of hair masks and anti snap treatments. I asked Emily how bad it was in her professional opinion and she said \"This has never happened to me and I'm so sorry\" she called her manager to ask if there was anything that could be done. I was not charged for the service. I am writing this as I am supposed to get another process done today. A protein treatment to hopefully save the hair I have left on my head and hopefully I won't need to shave my head. My hair has been the topic of conversation at work this week. In management meetings and while I'm working with advisors on how to treat customers well. It is embarrassing and has put a damper on my whole week and outlook. I know it's hair and it will grow back but I've been growing it out for over a year and a half, treating it well and trimming the ends. This is a nightmare! I will update this once I'm done and hopefully there is a light at the end of thus fried hair tunnel! They are the experts. I expected someone to say, we can't do this or let me get help or let's stop for now and have you come back if my hair was showing signs of irreparable damage. This is why I went to them in the first place as I didn't want to damage my hair :( last night I went back for a protein bond conditioner cut and color. My hair looks 1 million times better the car is great and hides the majority of the damage done to my hair the color splotchy and a couple of areas but is still decent enough for me to leave my home without having a hat.

She assured me that they could do the style/color I was asking for without a problem. She quoted me a price of $180, explaining her prices were higher because she was a manager. I was okay with the price as long as I could get it done the way I wanted. I ended up booking an appointment with someone else as the manager was not available during the day/times that I could make it in. She assured me again, that the girl that I was making the appointment with was \"great with color\" and would \"have no problem getting me the results I was after\". \n\nThe day came for me to get my hair done, I explained to her exactly what I explained to the manager as to what I wanted and my failed experiences with the same look in the past, she also assured me that it wouldn't be a problem to obtain the look. She then quoted me a price, a price (I watched her price out at a lower quote then proceeded to price our a higher quote to get the quote up to the managers quoted price, even tho she was not a manager) I found out later that her prices are in fact cheaper than the managers so I was overcharged for the individual doing my hair. STRIKE ONE! \n\nOnce my hair was done with the color, she blowdried and cut my hair (cutting off most of the color she put in my hair) and also cut it inches shorter than I told her I wanted. It was like she was just doing what she felt like doing versus what I asked for the entire time. STRIKE TWO! \n\nI was very unhappy with my hair but have always been one to pay for a service that I am given (happy or not). I went to the register to pay which led me to stand there for 15 min (making a bad situation worse) while two employees took FOREVER (15 mins) to help the customers they were helping when I initially walked up. I ended up having to pull an associate off of the floor to take my payment, I seriously almost walked out without paying which after the headache I have endured, I should have done just that. STRIKE THREE! \n\nAfter going home and looking at my hair a bit better as well as having someone take a picture of the back the next day, I was even more unsatisfied with what I was left with. This is when I contacted corporate online, who wrote me back with an apology and stating that a manager from the location would be in contact with me to make the matter right. I didn't hear from anyone after that and I have still yet to hear from anyone.

I heard NOTHING! STIKE FOUR!!!!! \n\nTo make everything EVEN WORSE as if it were possible, the next time I washed my hair, ALL of the color had completely washed out of my hair! I was assured by the girl that did my hair (Aire) and the manager that booked my appointment that it would last AT LEAST 4-6 weeks if not longer. Because this was one of my BIGGEST concerns since this is what had happened in the past. STRIKE FIVE!\n\nI will never get my hair done or even shop at an Ulta ever again in my life.

Because of this I didn't receive a statement until July 2017 showing a balance due. I think the account was in some \"pending\" state.  c) by the time I got the statement, my FSA funds were forfeited since it was well past the end of year, AND my insurance carrier had changed.

Once that was over I was placed in a 3rd waiting room that had 6 chairs and people were standing in the hallway.  I was there to be treated for minor diabetic retinopathy, tests were performed and when the MD came in to talk to me about the results his brief response was \" ehh its not too bad but your a candidate for the laser procedure\"... well alright then, I was then moved into the room where the procedure was supposed to be done. The assistant just told me to have a seat and walked out. No explanation, no paper work... few minutes later comes in either a billing manager or office manager to tell me that I have a $1,000 deductible to meet that has to be paid at the end of the visit. First of all I was never told about anything costs besides my copay and that I would need to have the money available that day. She was very rude, pushy and arrogant. I proceeded to tell her I do not have the funds at the moment and I would like to reschedule. She kept telling me I have to pay it and if it comes down to it they could offer me a payment plan of that I would put at least Half down. I was absolutely shocked by how demanding she was of the money. Then she gets up and just walks out, again a few minutes later another women comes in and tells me that Dr. Halpner insists that i have this procedure today(she made it sound like I was gonna go instantly blind the second i walked through the door for a diagnoses that was described at \" ehh its not too bad\" and that i was not going to leave.

I wanted my forehead & around the eyes done. I asked the assistant twice. She said \"oh, they'll go over everything.\" The assistant numbs me, Dr. Juneau comes in, and it's over before I could think to ask a 3rd time. For this bit of Botox, I was charged $600. Although I felt the entire situation was a little pushy, I didn't say anything. \n\nI was told on my way out that I needed to make a 2-week follow up because Dr. Juneau likes to \"make sure everything is alright.\" It was clear within a few days that it wasn't alright. I was completely asymmetrical. \n\nI made an appointment and then sat in the waiting room for about an hour before even being taken back. Dr. Juneau mentioned \"oh yeah, you don't want to look like you're giving a creepy wink.\" She was very kind and corrected it. \n\nOn my way out, the technician said \"okay, I think you're good to go since this was a follow up.\" I then hear this woman behind the counter named Amie yell \"no, he still needs to pay a copay.\" I walked to the counter, expecting to encounter a regular human. Instead, I got quite possibly one of the rudest, most surly, miserable souls I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. I mentioned \"Oh, I thought this was a follow up because my Botox wasn't right.\" Her response, condescending, \"well you still have to pay a copay, sir\" as if I was trying to cheat her out of something or was just being cheap. I clenched my teeth and paid. The more I thought about it though, I still don't understand why I was asked to pay $40 copay for a cosmetic procedure that I was paying for out of pocket and not going through insurance. Amie was quite possibly one of the rudest people I've encountered in a long time. She asked me 3 times if I wanted a receipt and got visibly frustrated when she had to pivot her chair to pick up a piece of paper. \n\nI then walked through the sea of younger women with their masked pulled down and buried deep into their cell phones at the front desk (waiting room now not busy). Despite 4-5 of them being there, no one said goodbye or thanks, and I was on my way! \n\nI spoke to some friends who've had Botox and they were horrified by both the cost and experience I had. I feel like I was both overcharged and treated like garbage by this office. I shouldn't have had to spend this much time or money to get what I got. Lots of frustration and I cannot recommend.  \n\nShout out to Fernando the assistant. He was kind, gentle, and easy to talk to.

Unfortunately, I would give the patient experience here a 1. I would give the overall nutritionist experience a 3 for proficiency. \n\nRegarding the experience, first you have to play phone tag with them to get something scheduled - they won't let you do it on-line or via e-mail. I also didn't receive an e-mail or any directions to the office or any e-mail or text reminder.  Yes, they called and left an appointment reminder message, but that also didn't have the directions.  They have changed their name, which made searching for the business and directions via Google, which I would usually do, difficult. I called the morning of my appointment and was told the office was on Mopac and Balcones. This matched the address I had in the previous e-mail, which was apparently old. So I went to their old office, also on Mopac and Balcones, but several blocks away. Even though I was early, getting lost made me 15 minutes late to the new appointment, which was then rushed. I had already read some books on the condition I was trying to address and gotten some advice and was really looking to up-level that with personal holistic approaches to my lifestyle, diet and living conditions. I was looking for a partner to help me, which is an approach I have seen some other healthcare professionals take. I feel what I got was a standard talk track and formulaic print out which was OK and a moderate improvement in what I already knew, probably about 15 minutes worth of value. I was hoping to leave feeling empowered, as the condition I have is difficult, and this just made me feel more frustrated. I would say my experience was similar to the review the person who had Type I Diabetes wrote.  \n\nSince I felt so rushed, I suggested that they update their address on their overall web presence so people don't have get lost and end up paying full price for an appointment that was cut short.  Additionally, the only time I had been quoted a price, it was few months earlier via e-mail. I went to pay and they told me the price had increased, even though it was nowhere on their website and had not been communicated to me. They also couldn't a accomodate a simple request to help with an insurance issue and seemed rushed even though there was no one in the office.  Updating their prices for full transparency and giving patients accurate directions seemed to be too much for them since they are a \"small business\" and can't afford it. Well, if they can't afford to do the things required to provide a good patient experience, I can't afford it to pay $139 and take an hour off of work for such a poor experience with only marginal value from a treatment perspective. \n\nIt could have just been a bad day, but I don't think this is the right place to go if you're looking for a good experience and a customized approach for your healthcare.", "date": "2016-05-24 16:03:57"}, {"review_id": "0AMTy740XtJCLT3uQxBeMw", "user_id": "CovK61yLomxUPcOHWfLk9Q", "business_id": "A9Q6My3XLiUNMnOec8cK4w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Best one in town.

This past weekend I started seeing \"floaters\" in my right eye. Understanding this maybe the first sign of a detaching retina, I called Dr Harbin's Office since he has been my grandfathers eye doctor for glaucoma and cataracts for years. \n\nIt was late in the afternoon and the telephone operator was courteous and listened to my concerns. She asked if I could hold while she reached out to the triage nurse, who promptly reviewed my symptoms then asked me to hold again while she consulted with the retina specialist, Dr. Halpern. \n\nWithin 7 minutes of placing the call, I had navigated access to the eye surgeon who understood the critical nature of my situation and gave me priority scheduling at 7am the next morning. \n\nThey asked me to go online and print new patient forms which I did, although it was slightly confusing because there is a practice with a similar name and I originally was at their website. Dr Halpern's Office is at a different location than where I had gone with my grandfather so I first went to the wrong location, but still was able to arrive at the Cumberland office only five minutes late. I checked in with my completed paperwork, ID and insurance card and was called back quickly for history and exam. The paperwork and history is the only part of the process that has room for improvement as both the forms and the oral history were redundant x3, but that is common in paper based practices and did not negatively impact my rating of the quality of care. Back to the main waiting room.\n\nBy nature, eye care is a multi step process often involving the administration if drops, followed by exam, possibly several cycles depending on the findings at each stag of the exam. While some patients may find the \"shuffling\" to be a bother, it is just a more efficient way to utilize exam space with expensive equipment than using them as holding space waiting for drops to do their work prior to proceeding to next phase of assessment or treatment. Good business practice, waiting areas are conveniently located and I did not see it as a problem because I understand they are not moving cattle but trying to maintain the cost of care as low as possible by maximizing the equipment in exam rooms for the purpose they are intended not as expensively equipped waiting rooms. \n\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes after my redundant history being taken, I was called back for my initial exam by Dr Halpern which immediately confirmed what I had suspected, a small tear in  the retina. that He said could treat it in the office the same day. It was now 8:30.\n\nI was moved to another small waiting area outside the laser treatment room and within a few minutes was ushered in, prepped with more drops, provided patient education and post treatment instructions, then Dr Halpern came back with his friendly , upbeat reassurances that set me at ease. Procedure done, checked out, eye shades in out the door in 2.5 hours.\n\nI think this is extraordinary! When I got ready to check out, they had a kiosk hearing screening machine which I availed myself to, confirming some hearing loss in left ear. Receptionist confirmed they had check with my insurance company and I did not have a patient payment due. \n\nThe high quality efficient care provided me with strong reassurance that I had made a wise decision to call as soon as I had the floaters. Potential further damage avoided!\nAreas for improvement are reducing the redundancy of the forms and history process and making sure you are offered sunglasses shields at checkout or in the exam room.

Upon first glance, I wonder if they understand their brand. They are dressed sloppily with unkempt hair in various stages of faded green, yellow, orange etc. You wouldn't guess that it's their job to promote makeup and hair care products. So both, the store and the women working there, are sloppy. But maybe they are helpful and courteous? NO. Today, my last trip to this store ever, I went in to purchase a specific prestige brand foundation. My shade was not displayed so I asked for help checking anywhere else where stock is kept. You would have thought I asked for a kidney. One quick glance in a drawer and I was told they don't have it and don't know when they will. I inquired about whether I could have a tester until more stock is ordered and she laughed and had a very snotty tone when she explained its their policy not to while rolling her eyes. I have had this situation occur in the past and have always received a sample to get me by until I can drop the $45 on a foundation they never seem to have in stock. I had decided on the way out to ask about a specific item and I asked MULTIPLE annoyed, angsty sales girls if they had it and if so, where was it in the store.

Dr. Barrett, whom I located on the ZocDoc app, accepted my insurance Federal BC/BS, and did a thorough exam: biopsied a couple of areas, removed skin-tacks, and treated some sun spots with liquid nitrogen. Upon departing, I paid a $40 co-pay and thought the matter was settled---see her in a year for a follow up, but was also notified that if anything popped up from the biopsies that I might be called with the results and also might need to schedule a follow-up visit. Not once did I think that I'd be charged for any co-insurance.  Well, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, this office will charge above and beyond what is \"allowable\" for your insurance, leaving you with an unpaid balance.  While I appreciate the professional service, I do not appreciate nontransparent practice of \"charge first\" ask the patient unapologetically later to pay, especially in these challenging times. So imagine my surprise when I found out at the register upon my follow-up visit that I had an outstanding $110 co-insurance payment due for procedures that were above the reimbursable threshold of my insurance carrier (Blue Cross / Blue Shield) and another Co-pay of $40 was also due. The registrar couldn't tell me whether further co-insurance fees were due. Had I been given the opportunity to say \"Doc, please only treat me up-to my COPAY and whatever my insurance allows. I would have been content.\" Now, however, I am holding my breath. I would say, buyer beware, and when you complete your paperwork at the office to be sure that the office's billing department only treats you for what your insurance can bear, otherwise it will be coming out of your pocket.

Long story short (no pun intended) I had a decent cut, but wanted a little more off the back and wanted to do some bright colors under my dark brown hair.  I scheduled a second appointment for the color- which took so long, there wasn't time for the fix of the cut, and I still had red in my hair so I scheduled a third appointment to fix both.  I literally didn't look at the peekaboo color because after 3hours and 20minutes I ran out of the salon and was late for work.  Fast forward to appointment 3, the stylist asked Rachelle the salon manager to help him with the shape of the shorter cut I had requested, and she went through the process and started the angle in the back for him.  I get washed up and he continues the cut, while my chin is down for him to cut the back and all of a sudden I see a large chunk of hair fall down and it was at least 3inches long!  I looked up and my long angled bob in front had been cut to just above my chin! It was supposed to be much longer and he stopped and got Rachelle.  When she came over I think I had started crying, because coincidentally my grandmother had passed away the day before and my emotions + the fact that my hair was awful looking now was too much. She could see that I was distraught and she finished the cut, offering to put in extensions for me and fix the color the next morning.  She went above and beyond to come in early and dye the extensions, and did all this in a time crunch because I had to fly out of town for a funeral the next day.  After many hours of her hard work I left the salon and cried tears of happiness because Rachelle had performed a hair miracle.  Thank the lord she was there that day, and has such skill to literally give me back the hair in the style and length I wanted.  None of my family noticed the extensions but I received many many compliments, including that my grandmother would have loved it.

It turns out they had me mixed up with another patient who was supposed to be getting skin tested, so I waited a while longer and finally ended up meeting with Dr Alvarez. \n\nDr Alvarez is fresh out of residency, and explained to me that not only would he not do any skin or blood testing for food allergies because, as he put it, intolerances \"aren't real\" and the blood tests \"aren't backed by science\" (what?). I asked him what my options were for figuring out my food allergies if I couldn't be tested, asking if an elimination diet (arguably the most accurate way to figure out food issues, generally highly recommended by allergists) would be my only option. He said he wouldn't recommend an elimination diet because \"I would risk developing new allergies\" (again, what?). I mentioned that I'd isolated soy as a possible problem and he said he wouldn't recommend avoiding it because I might, again, \"develop a *real* allergy\" to it. Because apparently there's no such thing as neurological symptoms associated with food allergies and unless you're at risk for anaphylaxis, it's not a \"real\" allergy. \n\nIn the mean time, Dr Alvarez made sure to try to prescribe me two medicines I didn't ask for nor want, tell me repeatedly that I need to lose weight, attempt to prescribe me heartburn medicine for no discernible reason other than me saying that post nasal drip causes stomach upset and, on rare occasions, heartburn (but no you should definitely take a prescription for it every single day when you get it maybe a couple times a month and you've explained that it is mild and not very bothersome and the *cause* is post nasal drip thanks to environmental allergens...). \n\nBasically, I would not recommend Dr Alvarez to anyone.

Then, lo and behold, the temporary fell off 30 days later, just as his covering and far more competent colleague predicted it would.  The best part is when I called back to speak to him about this, he ignored my phone calls and instead, sent a letter of termination to me in the mail stating that he was ending my status as a patient in his practice.  I'd also like to point out that he did this when he knew I was out of state for 6 weeks.  Clearly he learned nothing from this mistake and wasn't going to fess up to it.     \n\nThere is a big difference between a medical provider who shoots the breeze and makes small talk because he wants his patients to like him (and accept his much higher than the norm fees) and a provider that shows true compassion for his patients.  From this review it should be clear where Vultaggio's priorities lie.  The extremely quick visit and the empty room are because he will make shortcuts to get you out on time, especially when it comes to leaving the office on time.  If you must go, don't go on a Friday, not that he's even in the office most Fridays....And don't count on getting any help unless you are paying for an appointment.  His secretary will never let you speak with him, no matter what the circumstances are.  She will block your calls.  He is never available, even though he spends half your appointment time trying to make small talk.\n\nPlease, heed my warning: there are far better options in the area.  Go into Boston if you can, if not, at least find a practice where there is some peer accountability.  I can only warn, unfortunately it took me 10 years before the last straw.  I will be filing a complaint with the Mass Board of Dental Medicine so that hopefully there will be some accountability in Vultaggio's practice and maybe that will decrease the risk of this happening to someone else.", "date": "2010-10-26 01:24:11"}, {"review_id": "H_ez1xr4ofjrnKnDlSFEoA", "user_id": "ktwpnV6f3ejFRxNHVoGYMQ", "business_id": "9ehk_B3F8O1wRSu0E5Lixw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Dr Ortiz literally changed my life.

She's excellent! I connected with Christi by chance through a mutual friend and couldn't be happier with the service I receive from her. I've had my hair cut by Christi three times now and always leave with a smile on my face. The first time she cut my hair I also asked to have about 8 inches removed, and gave only some general guidance and a couple of pictures as examples of the style I wanted. I went from having a nondescript and shapeless style--formerly an angled bob that had grown out unevenly over time--to rocking an awesome quiff with amazing volume and shape. \n\nWhether I see Christi at four weeks on the dot after my last appointment or have to wait a couple extra weeks, I show up with no split ends and my hair still looking fantastic, but always leave happier after we touch it up. I also like that she learns and remembers what tools and products clients do and don't like for styling. She always has something great to share with me based on my past preferences but also never pressures me to buy anything. I feel like a person at Ulta and not a commodity, even though the salon is nested inside of a large store.\n\nChristi is extremely kind and respectful, checking in regularly and asking detailed questions before making any changes to a client's hair. She is also great about stopping on a dime if a client feels apprehensive or wants to change direction mid-stream. And she does an excellent job of mapping out the lines of a cut using clips before beginning work, and makes sure to give clients regular 360-degree views of the progress using mirrors. I never worry that she is going to butcher my hair or ignore my guidance about how to tweak the style. Finally, Christi also works very slowly and gently, never pulling on my scalp or turning my head sharply. Overall, working with her is a pleasure.\n\nIn terms of Ulta itself, as other customers note, checking out can take time. However, I feel the extra time is worth the convenience and extremely fair price of getting a cut here. Full cuts and styles at Ulta run about 35% cheaper than what I've seen at independent salons, with no loss in quality of service. Ulta also offers great discounts on first-time service and referral bonuses for customers, as well as great coupons and sales for members who do want to buy products in-store or online.

They seem to have a good selection of products. However, my review is specifically for the salon section at this Ulta location.  \n\nI made an appt with Neal. I'm fairly new to Orlando and had been looking for a good colorist. I found him via Instagram and followed his work. I felt he was a good fit for what i wanted done to my hair. I needed a root touch-up and balayage highlights for a pop of color. When I arrived at the salon, I learned that i was not scheduled correctly and was apparently overbooked. The \"funny\" thing is, I was scheduled by the salon manager (forgot his name). Shouldn't he of all people know how to schedule an appt at the salon in which he manages? Neal was kind enough to fit me in anyway but he had to reschedule other clients to make it happen. I'm sure those clients weren't very happy about that.\n\nBefore we began, we started with a brief consultation. I explained that I had had a bad experience previously at another salon and was told since I had shorter, dark brown/black hair (about chin length) & had been using box dye, that i couldn't do ombre or balayage. Furthermore, I was told it was better suited for people with longer hair. Again, this was at another salon i had been to previously. \n\nI asked Neal for his professional opinion and whether or not what I wanted could be achieved. He assured me i was misinformed and that highlights could in fact be done on any length of hair. He just couldn't guarantee that my hair would lift even with the bleach. I understood that and i felt comfortable enough to proceed with services. Long story short, this man FRIED my hair! He used a high developer, put me under heat, and left me processing too long. He was doing someone else's hair while i sat processing. My hair was a bright yellow/orange and was literally falling out. The ends were SO brittle and fragile. My scalp burned! & no, i'm not allergic to the dye or the bleach. It was awful! He tried to cut some of the ends off but it was no use. my hair was breaking off even while passing a comb through it. It was like snowing brittle, hay-like hair. He kept cutting and i ended up with one side longer than the other. He just gave up trying to salvage any of it. \n\nThis was a disaster! Worst salon experience ever. The worst part is, that weekend was my child's birthday. I was going out of town the next day. I left the salon and had to return the next day, before I caught a flight at the airport, to speak with the manager who was not present the day of my appt. When he inspected the damage, in his words, \"it was not that bad\". Excuse me?! He gave me a goodie bag with free samples of random stuff and told me I didn't have to worry about paying anything. Gee, thanks! like any of that would make it better. I wasn't planning on paying anyway. \n\nI had high hopes Neal would be my go-to stylist here in Orlando but it didn't work out that way. I'm more scared than ever to go to a salon or ever use bleach again, for that matter. Idk what happened but I would not recommend. I sure hope others have a better experience than i did.", "date": "2015-11-13 02:41:22"}, {"review_id": "hhFcyBvo8r1O14_A9pG4wQ", "user_id": "nGt671yeno2JV8ze3TX5HQ", "business_id": "-Q1qcyni6Y2XAoUS4cQ0fQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So ok today i went to Alergy and Asthma Consultants for the very first time ( i was referred by doctor Kelly Alberta).

He was relaxed, friendly, inquisitive and informative, and his unhurried approach made it clear that he was genuinely focused on taking as much time as was needed to get to the root of my problem.

I had scary visions of lots of skin tests and a lifetime of weekly allergy shots, but this is not in my future.  \n\nMy initial appointment lasted 2 hours and left me with a great feeling about my doctor and this office.

Prior to being referred to Dr. Alvarez, I was seen by two other dermatologists and two allergists.  I had undergone PATCH testing, nutritional counseling, two years of food testing, chemical and environmental testing, bleach baths, special diets, food diaries, sun lamps, steroid creams, balms, special shampoos (too many to list) prednisone medications etc.\n\nI had exhausted my Dr's and every solution available and was seen by the Dr's at the Mayo Clinic. They helped me sort things out however I still had to follow up at home with limited options.\n\nI have been a patient of Dr. Alvarez since 2//17 and since then he continues to rule in and out ways to help me. We have found  Immunology shots, Eucrisa and Dupixent Injections to be the best of what I have needed.  I was one of the first to use Dupixent in the Allergy & Asthma Consultant practice thanks to Dr. Alvarez!  I am now clear of my eczema and rarely have flare ups. My life has changed because I am managing my eczema.  \n\nDr. Alvarez is compassionate, kind and goes out of his way to help his patients.  I have never experienced a Dr. seeking me out in the waiting room to speak to me. He is invested in the care of his patients and takes the time to educate and give resources as well.   Most of all he took the time and patience to persevere with me. I have recommended him to several people. THANK YOU DR.

Stay far away!  I wish I would have checked this site before going to this office.\n\nThe office staff during my visits were okay, not the friendliest.  Unlike most others, I haven't had to wait long (maybe 10 -15 minutes).  The two visits I've had here have been about an hour long total, but I think it's because I had a crappy doctor that no one else wanted to see.\n\nI came here because my eyes were stinging and burning, especially in the morning. Dr. Stoller looked at my eyes with a light, then pulled up my eyelids.  He told me, he had no idea what was wrong with me, but my eyelids were 'all chewed up'.  He told me there was absolutely nothing wrong with eyes.  They were in perfect condition.  He told me to get some over-the-counter eye drops and see him next week.  I was surprised he didn't write me a prescription, but didn't question it.\n\nMy condition got worse over the next week.  The left eye swelled up so badly that sometimes I couldn't open it.  My eyes were also stinging very badly (like someone was putting needles in them.)  I was also very sensitive to bright light.  I told Dr. Stoller about my symptoms and he shrugged them off.  During this second visit, he was in a very bad mood and yelled at me several times.  When he shined a light in my eyes and I winced, he said \"Oh stop it!  I know for a fact you're not in pain!\"  He also said the reason I was getting worse is because I was skipping doses of the eye drops.  When I said I wasn't, he called me a liar and said my eyes were not swollen, just a little red.  He told me to start putting over the counter mineral oil drops in my eyes and take the highest does of omega-3's I could find.  I told him I eat sushi and salmon twice a week and take omega-3 (in liquid form) already, but he said it wasn't enough and that I need to take omega-3 in pill form.  By this time, I was getting the feeling that he was a quack and was planning to go to another doctor for a second opinion.\n\nA few days later, my left eye swelled up even more and was beginning to turn purple.  I was in such pain, that most of the day I couldn't even function.  If I so much as slightly brushed my eye, I was in agony.  I couldn't find see another eye doctor right away, so I stopped in to the CVS Minute Clinic.  The doctor there diagnosed me with an bacterial eye infection.  When I told the CVS doctor about what Dr. Stoller said, she was shocked.  She said it was extremely obvious to her just by looking at me that my eyes were anything but fine.  She said he should have put me on antibiotics as soon as he saw my eyelids were 'chewed up'.

I thought I have to move out of Austin to feel better. Dr Vigo gave me a couple of shots that helped with the cough and congestion with direction to stop taking antihistamines to he have the fun and exciting allergy testing.\n\nI was introduced to the nicest nurse. I think her name was Shannon whom preformed the procedure of 64 sticks, 24 of them intradermal by syringe and 40 just little needle sticks. I should remember her name, after all she gave me 64 reasons I should but she had a great hand, was well organized with a great bedside manner and informative to make me feel at ease. She turned on an video which talked about allergies and treatments to help take my mind off of the sticks and a hour later she documented the results. lucky needles don't bother me. just mild discomfort. She gave a anti itch medicine and  stressed the importance of not scratching them to prevent infection of the injection sites.\n\nThe staff got me an immediate next day appointment for Dr Vigo to access the results and come up with a medical plan. I was expecting allergy shots or drops if my insurance would cover but he instead wanted to try to treat it with just medicines. That was great news. I work long hours and taking time off to get shots would definitely hinder my work load and schedule. He prescribed me some different medications and consulted on the use and how each medicine takes care of my variety of conditions and as a parting gift gave me some very pricy samples and a couple of coupons. Unfortunately for me 2 of the prescriptions are not covered by my insurance. Sigh. I go back in 5 weeks to see how well the medicine regiment goes. \n\nWell great news is my constant coughing has stopped. I greatly reduced blowing my nose. My voice is recovering from the irritation and I just feel 100% better\n\nI strongly recommend Dr Vigo and his staff to handle your Austin Cedar allergies.Yes, I noticed that 1 of the front desk ladies was moody at my first visit but in my subsequent visits she was very nice. The other front office staff ladies are very nice. I don't know how well the allergy shot people are but from what I've seen since they are out in the open in a side open room in the waiting room.

I waited forever to get in with the doctor, doctor stoller-even though the ER said I needed to see doctor Sorkin, but they changed my doctor without telling me...so after waiting forever, I sit down with Dr stoller and before looking at my eye he tells me that my doctor and the ER were stupid for sending me to him, and that I was fine. He hadn't even looked at my eye!  I informed him that it was filled with blood and that it has gotten worse over 10 days, not better, and that it's painful and my vision is impared. He told me broken blood vessels in the eye were normal and it would go away in a few days. I informed him it has been 10 days and it is getting worse by the day. He said, again, it's a broken blood vessel and will get better within a few days. So I asked him about the pain and vision issues and he told me I was fine. I forced him to actually look at my eye, because at this point he hadn't looked at it yet. He looked real quick, and said I was fine again. I then informed him that the ER wanted him to check my reitna and he was annoyed, but dilated my eyes anyways and sat me in the waiting area for almost an hour. He then brought me back in the room, looked real fast and said I'm fine, again. I told him that my vision was spotty and blotchy and it was concerning and he told me that was normal! He then told me I had a sinus infection, and that he would prescribe me an antibiotic. He called my doctor first, and my doctor (who had just seen me that morning) told him he wanted me to get a CT scan. Dr stoller ordered a CT scan and said it was for a sinus infection. When I got to thehospital for the scan, I told them what was happening and they said there's no way that's a sinus infection, and that they needed to fix the order and do a more extensive scan. The next day, I received a call from another hospital asking me to schedule my scan, which I had done the day before. Come to find out, the office just sent the order to multiple hospitals. By noon the next day, Dr stoller had not called me back with results from the scan, for I called my primary. He said that there's definitely no sinus infection, and that otherwise, the scan looked good as well. He told me not to take the antibiotic this doctor randomly perscribed me and he wanted me to see someone else that he works closely with. I then went to the place the doctor recommended (who never said I was ok without looking, did a full exam, and checked every) and come to find out, I had a blood clot! The new eye doctor found this within 10 minutes of my appointment! I soent two hours waiting around for doctor stoller to give me a random perscription, order a test I didn't need, diagnose me with something I didn't have just to get me out of his hair, and not even look at my eye! I completed a total of a 30 minute appointment with the new eye doctors office to find out I had a blood clot that doctor stoller never cared to pay attention to, because he was too busy telling me I was fine and trying to push me out the door. A blood clot! He wrote it off as a sinus infection and wrote me a perscription! I'm glad nothing serious happened, or a law suit would have been on his hands. Needless to say, do not go here!

Had to come back twice which is normal for my hair but end up costing about $400 for haircut and balayage, excluding the generous cash tips I gave her twice. That is more with someone with lots of experiences with dying hair and cutting hair. Okay fine, I would have been happily to pay for it if it turned out great. It's been a month and I still hate my hair. She didn't even did anything to the back to make it a true balayage. It's just bleached at the ends of my hair. Going back to Watertown for balayage where there are expertise stylists. Oh, typically the stylists would curl your hair when you get balayage done but not here so I left not being satisfied or in love with my hair...", "date": "2019-11-03 21:11:52"}, {"review_id": "3YtPqoGRA4ZAuQ4o_FLCUA", "user_id": "UjMVrA-8ttV1xFLgVLcGVg", "business_id": "-Q1qcyni6Y2XAoUS4cQ0fQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 8, "funny": 6, "cool": 7, "text": "I love this place.\n\nSmooth, efficient experience right from the beginning.

I was over charged and my hair was treated with very little care.\n\nI am a Black woman with natural/not relaxed hair that's new to Austin so I was looking for someone to blowout/straighten my hair so that I could get a trim. I asked the question very openly and specifically if Ulta had a stylist on staff that had experience with styling hair like mine. They referred me to Ana. She looked at my hair, assured me she could style my hair, quoted me a $54 price for a shampoo, blowout, & trim, and I set an appointment for the next day. \n\nWhen I arrived, she was running behind, but was polite and apologetic about the wait. She shampooed my hair and placed me under the dryer for my hair to dry before she would blow dry it. I haven't had my hair straightened in over a year since I stopped chemically straightening it, so while this seemed odd to me, I wasn't experienced enough to argue her method. After the dryer she sat me in her chair, put a very tiny dab of some cream on my hair, and proceeded to blow dry my hair. I immediately smelled my hair burning and could see lots of smoke and told her that I was worried she was burning/damaging my hair. She simply blew off my concern by saying it was the product and not my hair. And then she placed another dime sized amount of the same cream on my hair. She basically dismissed my concern and just kept going. Another associate even walked over to remark about all of the smoke.  Once she'd gotten my hair moderately straight, but still extremely frizzy, she haphazardly trimmed it. I had to ask her to trim additional spots that seemed damaged to me. After the trim she used the flat iron. And then the blow dryer again. And then flat iron again. Needless to say my hair endured a lot of heat/abuse that day.  And it wasn't very straight when she was done. \n\nI thanked her through my disappointment and proceeded to the register to pay- only to be disappointed again. While she'd quoted me $54, I was charged $64 \"because she used the flat iron.\" That is not a charge that she mentioned I would incur (neither in her quote nor when she was performing the service). I feel as though I was overcharged because she didn't accurately know how to treat my hair and I paid for her inexperience.\n\nWhile Ana is a lovely person, she was not the appropriate stylist. I had to go home and add additional product to my hair and style it again myself in order for it to be presentable that evening. The blow out didn't even last until the next day.\n\nI would have appreciate immediate honesty from the time of consult to avoid this expensive mistreatment of my hair. \n\nI do not recommend Ulta as an appropriate place for heat straightening natural Black hair.", "date": "2015-08-19 16:12:35"}, {"review_id": "exoXeE_rLw9X4y7yfSZ6UA", "user_id": "CUU_SVpheVGIilr5kUaJ1Q", "business_id": "rxyzvQi9UNZaSsMjFf1P_A", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 6, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "What can I say?

At 2:20 the girl comes to get me. No apology for being a little late. Just hey what's up no big deal. I sit down with her and she starts to color my hair. Around 2:50 she finished putting the product in my hair and said \"oh by the way, someone's coming in at 3:00pm so we'll just move you over.\" What? Are you serious? Second red flag. I was kind about it and just moved over to the next chair to sit there while the next client came in and the product sat in my hair. 30 minutes was the amount of time it should have sat in my hair. Almost 50 minutes later, after washing and cutting this other clients hair, it's time to wash mine. Finally. I mean my phone is dying, at this point I've been here for 2 hours. While washing my hair she says she's going to give me a complimentary treatment. Product should sit for about 5 minutes. I've had this treatment a few times before. 20 minutes later she had NO choice but to come get me because I was hogging one of the wash stations and the other employees with clients were kinda whispering around \"What is she doing here? Who's client is she?\" As if me being there for now 2.5 hours wasn't bad enough. Let's just embarrass me too and talk about me like I'm oblivious to the English language. By the time she came to get me I just told her to dry my hair and let me go. Nothing else. She STILL wasn't done with the previous client! So I tried to brush my own hair with my fingers and found this HUGE dreadlock attached to some of my hair. That hair was stuck to my head when I came in.... But nevertheless. The cashier asked me what I want to tip, and at this point I tell her \"honestly? Nothing. My appointment was interrupted by another clients and it took 2.5 hours\" her response? \"Oh, glaze takes a while\" \n\nOh, but it doesn't. Don't make excuses.

I was happy I at least got some reaction. I will say I always respect businesses that contact me for good or bad reviews to get more feedback.

I am an engineer (jeans/shirt type) who recently got promoted to manager and wanted to dress a little more professional at work.  I hate shopping (can never find the right clothes that fit me) and had no idea of how to 'put an outfit together'.  Amy was wonderful, she met at our house and asked me basic questions to get an idea of what I was looking for.  Then she went through my closet to see what I had so far and this was more helpful than I thought it would be.  (Thought she would just help me shop).  \n\nWhile going through my closet she did a great job of pointing out the positives on the items I already owned (ie, these are good color choices for you; this would look more professional if you paired it with such-a-such, etc). She also helped me trim out the clothes that weren't working for me. For example, I had 4 dresses but really only 1 fit me 'correctly', the other 3 fit, but they didn't look that great on me and I never knew why.  Amy was able to pinpoint the area that wasn't working (ie for one it was the line that should have been under my bust).  \n\nOn to the shopping, Amy took me to a couple of places that were tailored to what I was looking for (which I honestly never shopped at before) and she is really good at determining my size and the type of cut that would work for me (ie straight vs trouser pants, which really, I would have no idea there was even a difference!). She was very conscious of my budget and was great at checking the wash requirements (which I often forget to look till I get home... dry clean only? UGH!).  She definitely seems to be 'in the know' for which stores are having sales and she even knows the differences between makers (brands?). For example when we went to a bigger department store she knew that a certain brand would have the type of clothes that fit me better vs others (vs me shopping by myself would have wasted hours going through every brand section and then giving up after trying 1/4 of the stuff).  Also what was great while shopping with Amy; each item I was trying on, for example pants, she would tell me what I could pair it with (that top with the blue, with the black cardigan, and your black boots, etc). So I had an idea of how to wear all these new clothes when she was gone.\n\nIf you are debating whether to try a personal shopper, I highly recommend it.

It's basically supposed to be your one-stop shop for all your superficial needs (I'm not hating. I wear makeup almost daily and dye my hair on the regular). \n\nHowever, the prices on the drugstore brands (Almay, Clearasil, etc). aren't low enough to warrant a special trip over here. Also, they don't carry the brands I look for when I go to Sephora (NARS is the first that comes to mind, but I know there have been a few occasions when I've gone specifically for  a certain brand and they don't carry it). The salon hair care section is great, but depending on what you need, it may be better to see if they carry it somewhere else, because again, the price will be cheaper. I buy Joico Color Endure since I have ombre hair and my ends are still fairly blonde, and I get it here for about $20. I saw it at HEB for $16. It's not a huge savings, but when you're ballin on a budget, it does make a difference. I personally haven't ever been to the salon, so I can't offer an opinion on that. \n\nI have three main reasons for coming here - thankfully, they carry Benefit Cosmetics, and if you sign up with Benefit, they'll shape your eyebrows for free on your birthday. They also send out ads to beauty club card members (I'm not sure what the name of the rewards program is!) that include coupons like $3 off a purchase of $10 or more. When I have those, I'll go here with no hesitation.

She didn't bat an eye, and asked me what I wanted to do (cut my very long curly hair up past my shoulders). She listened to me, looked at some pictures I brought, and didn't try to talk me out of it (past stylists have told me my hair would look bad short).

It's true, it doesn't really compare to Sephora (which is like me walking into an all-you-can-eat buffet of GORGEOUSNESS HELLO!), but Ulta is just as great in a different way. They have a smaller selection of \"prestige\" cosmetics, as they call them, but for lack of quantity at this location, they have some really excellent brands available. Napoleon Perdis, Bareminerals, Urban Decay, Too Faced, and Smashbox, just to name a few. I actually think it's great that they have drugstore brands there. Sometimes you just need a cheapie tube of mascara, but hey, those prestige brand eyeshadows pack just the right punch! However, this review is not just about the makeup porn. \n\nThere is a friendly and excellently staffed salon right there in the store at your disposal. Just a few months ago I walked in desperately frustrated with the damaged state of my hair, asked a few questions of one the stylists about services and any treatments available to repair said damage, and the next thing I know I'm setting up an appointment. Got in the very next day, and came out with a super freaking cute haircut and silky soft hair that had previously been the texture of straw. \n\nIn fact, I liked the stylists here so much I've pretty much switched to coming here regularly. The stylists here are just as skilled as other, much more expensive salons, for nearly half as much. At my old salon I'd be lucky to walk out without paying less than $100 for just a CUT. At Ulta's salon, cut's for women start at $40. I usually get the master service for $50 which includes a leave-in protein conditioning treatment that is helping my hair recover from many months of bleaching it. I just went in today, matter of fact and got an exceptionally cute trim and decided to take advantage of a 40% off hair color promotion and get my hair glazed! Much less harsh than regular chemical coloring and my hair is now super, super shiny. \n\nThey also offer facials and skin treatments as well as waxing. The salon here isn't necessarily a walk-in salon (in fact, I recommend setting appointments), but it was super awesome to walk in, ask the esthetician if she was free, and take care of my eyebrow waxing needs right then and there. She tried to book me for a facial at the time, but the $10 for my first time facial waxing was all I really had at my disposal. However, I'd definitely return for a facial here when I save up some extra ~beauty needs~ money.\n\nBottom line, I'm definitely a fan! Also! The location in Tualatin is SUPER HUGE and has a much larger selection of cosmetic brands, but like I said, I'm raving about the salon here.

My last cut/style experience wasn't the greatest.  This one takes the cake from start to finish.  \n\nFirst, she actually listened to me.  I was preparing to have around 8 inches cut off.  I was slightly nervous about the new length and she took my concerns seriously and properly advised me.  We mutually decided what to do and she began.  She's a very sweet and personable person so that made my time there very enjoyable.  She asked several times during the actual cutting process how I felt about the length so far.  When she was finished cutting, she asked if I wanted just the standard blow dry or an extra costing curl or straighten.  I chose to splurge ($10) on having it curled since that's not something I ever have time for and have never had it done professionally.  She turned me away from the mirror after blow drying and began to curl.  When she was finished, she added some product and styled it a bit.  When she turned me around, I was blown away at what I saw in the mirror.  I barely even recognized myself.  She made me feel absolutely beautiful, me the humble mother of two toddlers who barely showers every day.  She didn't just cut my hair, she cared about what I wanted, how I felt about it, and then made me feel amazing.

I really wanted balayage highlighting done to my hair (I have a long angled bob). When I sat down with my \"master colorist\" she told me that my hair would not look good with balayage (due to the length). I was kind of okay with this because I had considered going full blond. I showed my colorist a photo of myself after highlights I'd received at the Ulta location in Sunset Valley and told her to use it as an example but I didn't need to go quite that blond. She made up my contract and quoted me $350 for a cut, color and highlights. I literally gasped--I was a little embarrassed about saying \"no way!\" when I was already seated but also decided if I could get beautiful hair that it was be worth it. Despite the fact that my hair had been full blond previously with highlights alone, this colorist insisted my hair needed to have all over color, highlights and some other treatments to achieve the same look. Of course, I was up-charged for my hair being \"long\" (despite it being too short for balayage, apparently) and my colorist cost extra for being a \"master\". \nMy haircut was great, I really loved it but the satisfaction ends there. At first my hair came out looking gray. I have olive toned skin so golden colors look best on me and I requested golden blond. I asked her \"what can we do to fix this?\" She scoffed and said \"Well this is contrary to what everyone wants, everyone does platinum but sure let me tone it for you.\" She toned my hair but it still came out looking more gray than I would like. But the worst part was that my hair was still decidedly BROWN, nowhere even close to blond. At this point, I had been in the salon for close to FIVE HOURS. I just wanted to get out of there. I tipped my stylist, paid my bill, left and cried in the parking lot. For one, I'm not a wealthy person, $350 meant I really had to cinch my belt for a couple months. For two, even though my hair didn't look \"bad\", I felt like I'd just spent $350 on a pair of designer red heels...only to receive blue ones. It just wanted what I wanted and it wasn't what I agreed to pay for. \nI went to my sister's house and we decided I really needed to call the salon. I was kept on hold waiting for the salon manager for a good while before someone came on and told me he'd call me the next day because he was busy with appointments at the time. When I did get the call back, it was late into the next day and the salon manager told me that if I came in they would be happy to fix it. Unfortunately, as I told him, I live in North Texas and I'd be leaving the following day to go back to work. He then essentially told me there was nothing they could do if I wouldn't let them fix it; I'd signed the waiver and their hands were clean. I asked if there was anything else to be done and he said well you can talk to the store manager. \nThe store manager called me back the following day and reiterated what the salon manager had said--but to add insult to injury, she had the audacity to tell me that because I tipped the colorist and left \"seeming happy\", I must have liked my hair. I was livid, I explained that I believe my colorist deserved a tip for having spent five hours of her time on my hair--even if I didn't like it, she put in labor--and that just because I didn't leave the salon in tears, doesn't mean they get to decide whether I seemed happy. More insult to injury? She claimed to have brought in a fellow stylist to testify to the fact that I seemed happy. At that point, I could barely hold it together. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? These stylists spend hours together gossiping and carrying on, they are friends, of course they defend one another. \nFinally, I called corporate. The lovely gentleman told me they would get me in touch with the district manager. I waited weeks to get in touch with this woman--of course she was busy and I understood but it would have been nice to at least receive an update of \"hey, we haven't dropped this, I promise.\" Eventually she did get back to me but she echoed many of the same sentiments as the salon and store managers--as it would turn out she was the interim district manager and she'd actually worked at some of those stores. I felt like I was battling against some sort of \"good ole boys\" club...these people KNOW each other and they're friends. She said she understood I live out of town but if she couldn't see my hair herself she didn't know how to determine who was \"right\" in this situation. I sent her the attached pictures and later received notification that I'd get $270 for the coloring services ONLY back in store credit (tip and cut were the additions). She apologized for the experience but I will never go back. \nI am still appalled that they didn't try to compensate me for all the trouble they caused or that they wouldn't offer me actual cash back. \nDO NOT GO HERE.

When I get it cut all I want is for it to tangle as little as possible.  I went to my last salon about 3 weeks ago and after wards it tangled even more than normal.  This morning I gave up and came to their doorstep hoping that I could drop in without an appointment and find someone to fix my hair.  Joanna (my stylist) was wonderful.  She listened to what I wanted and then proceeded to cut my hair.  After she blew it out she went through it again to trouble shoot the areas that were still tangling.  She did a fantastic job.  My hair will always tangle some, but she made it so that I only get 3-4 snarls a day rather than the normal 15-20 or the 30 I've been getting lately.  She also gave my hair a nice shape so it looks good, both when it's down and when it's in a pony tail which is how I normally wear it.  She didn't try to pressure me to buy any products and while I was there the other employees were very helpful to the other customers.  I even had the cashier help me find some scented body oil that I had been looking for.  Every employee was very friendly and helpful and the store was clean and smelled nice.

I get my Bare Minerals makeup here and also buy the Giovanni and Mop hair products here. They have drugstore brand makeup lines like Maybelline, Cover Girl, Almay, etc. but they also have higher end brands like Bare Minerals. They also offer a lot of higher end skincare lines like Kinerase. So this is a fun store to shop if you're into beauty products. It's sort of a midrange store between the low-end experience of a drugstore and a higher end experience of a Sephora or nice department store.\n\nAs for the hair salon, I would never have thought to consider having my hair done at an Ulta hair salon. But when I moved to Atlanta from California about six months ago, I didn't know where the heck to start. It has been months since my last hair cut and I needed someplace close to my office so I could get an appointment during lunch. When I was buying some makeup and got a 20% coupon for the salon, I figured I'd give it a shot. \n\nWell, to my pleasant surprise, I got a wonderful haircut from the Salon Manager, Kelly Craig. It always annoys me when a hair stylist asks you what you want (not that they shouldn't do that), but doesn't have any of their own opinions about what would look good on you. When I asked Kelly what she thought woudl be a good cut for my face shape, she had definite ideas. I trusted her to run with them and got a fabulous haircut. I have long, fine dark hair. it is also very curly/wavy and tends toward frizziness in humidity. I often straighten it, but also wanted a cut that would look good if I let it air dry. She gave me a cut that had great shape and gave a little lift in the back so my hair didn't look so heavy. \n\nAnyway, for a $50 haircut (before discount!), this place is a great deal. Kelly has been cutting hair for like 20 years and definitely knows what she's doing.

I had a dryer on top of my head and one pointed at each ear. I sat there for 20 minutes while she worked on her walk in customer. I could have dried my hair myself in less than half that amount of time if she would have given me a hairdryer. Then she came back after the 20 minutes and said she is still not done with her walk in customer, so I need to go to the front and pay. I hadn't even seen my hair in the mirror yet but she was asking me to pay. I had to walk through the store from the back where the salon is all the way up to the front and wait in line to pay, all the while I'm wearing two black capes and my hair is all in a curly frizzy mess from sitting in a wind tunnel for 20 minutes. I couldn't bear to go back there and wait any longer for her to attempt to style my hair, when I could probably get home and do it myself a lot quicker, so I just left. I had been shoved to the side and forgotten, then asked to pay without even seeing her work, and then embarrassed by having to walk through the store looking the way I did. To top it all off, I was charged $88 for the service, which I would expect to pay at a much classier salon, not a beauty store. AND I expressed my dissatisfaction with the manager at the front desk.

While she was definitely on the right track regarding the color (I like it cool, almost ashy; never golden or Mufasa-ish), many of the roots were far from my actual root, which is aggravating when you're blonding b/c it is so noticeable. Additionally, she should have re-highlighted more of the rest of my hair, as the toner did not fully work, which left me with two-toned hair.\n\nI called and let them know that I needed someone to fix it, and they set me up with Anna. Anna definitely had a better idea of what I was going for. She went in aggressively and did a better job of getting close to the roots (though there are still several places that are too far from my head, and her reasoning was that she \"got as close as she could,\" which just tells me that she was in a hurry, as she was overbooked). Additionally, there are still several places that are Mufasa-golden-brassy, and I specifically said I didn't want any of that left, as I am far too fair for that color. Her reasoning was that she was going to use purple shampoo to help with that, but \"we were out back there.\" (If I'd known this, I would have gladly purchased some Joico myself; we were, after all, in a salon that was in actual Ulta)\n\nThey didn't charge me for the second round since it was meant to fix the first round, and so all I needed to do was leave a tip for Anna, and I appreciate that consideration. They also squeezed me in and were able to reschedule me quickly when I had a snafu that morning, which I appreciate very much. I also noticed that their pricing for a full head of highlights (112$) is a bit low for the time they take with you (and also incongruent with other pricing - 49$ for a cut and style, which, if you're just getting a trim, is overpriced compared to the highlights), which is why I made sure both times to tip accordingly. I would rather pay more up front for more time making sure the roots are correct and the color is matched appropriately. \n\nIf you do try this out, I would recommend asking for a color specialist (I saw Irene, the first person I was matched up with, doing some good work on a brunette two chairs over) and make sure to be *very specific and proactive. There's not much \"How do you like this?\" and \"What can we improve?\" going on. The burden of that is placed on you. I'm choosing three stars because blonde is hard and I am particular, and the second time was a dramatic improvement over the first.\n\nAs far as the store goes, it's an Ulta like any other, except for the Benefit Brow bar, which I've heard good things about (though I have not tried it).", "date": "2016-07-20 14:09:27"}, {"review_id": "4nhxsleFI7eoOlczQLc_uw", "user_id": "ZMJO5Dq8lNuQnE5gpBjI-w", "business_id": "EajjpqLTxc7ktSPTFYvmlw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Went in for one thing came out with 7 and a credit card.

I love the selection of Urban Decay here at this location- I had gone to the Arboretum/Great Hills area one earlier that week in search of a Naked Palette from Urban Decay (which is out of stock most of the time from what I understand) and of course it was all sold out there.  Plus, they didn't have brushes.\n\nSo the other day I decided to try the one that was closer to my house anyway and lo and behold they had nearly a complete representation of the Urban Decay line right at my fingertips.  There were 3 Naked Palettes, so I gladly snatched one up.  I also noticed that they had brushes and nearly every eyeshadow shade and palette in stock.  At least now I know I can get what I need in this location.\n\nWhen I went, it was a Sunday and it was very busy.  I still had someone ask me if I could be helped- but it only happened once and they didn't try to push anything on me (I'm a fan of non-pushiness).\n\nThey also have a free rewards program, but it looks like you have to spend at least $50 a quarter to reap any benefits from it.  Well... actually on second thought the stuff they sell is pretty expensive- especially the good stuff.

I needed a new pot of Bare Escentuals blush (which can only be found at specialty beauty stores like this). Immediately, I was greeted by a smiley young thing, and asked if there was anything in particular I was looking for. I asked if there was anyone who was specialized in Bare Escentuals. The greeter wasn't, so she guided me towards a blonde consultant named Christina. Ulta was out of the BE shade she had originally picked out for me, so she thoughtfully chose a similiar shade from a similar brand (PUR Minerals). Throughout this process, Christina was pleasant and we gabbed about this makeup line vs. that one, etc, as only girly-girls love to do.\n\nAs I walked to the counter to pay, the cashier's perky smile fell when she saw my coupon in my hand, and my blush in the other. \"Ohhh...this isn't good for any of the Prestige Cosmetics.\"\n\n\"What's  a Prestige Cosmetic?\" I asked.\n\n\"Any of the cosmetics over here,\" she said, as she pointed to one half of the store.   \n\n\"You mean, HALF THE STORE?\"\n\nI crumpled up the coupon and gave her my credit card.

We accepted only I arranged to trade a facial for the refund. The facial was pure heaven seriously and I highly recommend seeing Karli there for a facial...however then came the manicure. Well, first of all I had an appointment but the girl took a walk in right when I was supposed to start. So a half hour later I started my manicure which was a horror show. The gal working on me had severe eczema and was not wearing gloves so i had to stare at her flaking scale ridden skin the whole time. Her nails were unmanicured and had dirt under them so it really should not have surprised me that she could care less about working on my hands! She barely removed my old color and when I commented she just kept saying she was adding more layers - well yeah ...she did FOUR plus the top coat and bottom coats! SIX COATS...and you could still see my old polish through. She barely filed my nails, did not clean them at all...it was horrible though I was the lucky one since my friend looked like hers were drawn with a crayon!! \n\nSo, moral of the story - get a facial by Karli but I cannot imagine willingly paying for any other services there.

This gal was so unfriendly and from the git go.  When I finally settled into offended I thought I would just see if she ever would try to make nice with a little superficial conversation.

I mean maybe just maybe she was having a very bad day but me thinks this is just her everyday way of being.  I won't go back to Ulta Salon because obviously they don't take enough care to hire people who are pleasant and who make their clients feel comfortable and welcome while sitting in the chair with trust.  I also noticed that she used several different products on my hair.  I didn't ask because at this point I knew who I was dealing with and had experienced her annoyed demeanor when I spoke about the cut I wanted.

She knew that this was to make up for how we were treated in my previous post. She was rude and good gods I wanted out of that chair. My nails looked better when my friends 4 yr old did them. I wish I was exaggerating. \n\nThere was no smooth edges my nails were different shades since they have to layer it. I am not talking one shade we are talking obviously different colors. She was in such a rush to get us done and out of the chairs since she had a \"paying\" client  walk in moments after we sat down.  I even had the gel manicure on my skin. For someone who left the nail polish more than 2mm from my nail bed.... and not even in smooth lines, she got it all over my skin and said the words....oh that will wash off later. ummmmm yea I am not okay with that. \nshe had told me she \"cut\" herself on the last haircut she did yet she didnt bother to put a bandaid on her her scaly cracking fingers that were bleeding. I was horrified and watched with a careful eye to make sure that she didnt actually get any body fluids on me. \nMy friend who was with me getting her free manicure as well..... had the princess pink color put on. It is not a dark color. Marisa didnt even bother to remove all her dark nail polish she did have on. so the sides of her nails had a dark stripe on each side. \nIn fact one of the girls up front saw my nails and suggested that \"I get a manicure in back from them\". I just looked at her, handed her my price slip and when she saw I DID have a manicure there she went pale and didnt say anything more about it. \n\nI was so hopeful that the manicure would go well.... I was not happy when I left. I wrote to Ulta again to let them know how this had gone horribly wrong. I stated very clearly that I did not want any more \"free\" services. I just wanted them to know of the horror show I walked out with on my  fingers. I advised that I did have photos so they could see how bad it was. I stated again that the facial was great..... however the manicure left a lot to be desired and was removed within one day. \nI NEVER got a response to my second complaint. I was not asking for more free stuff in fact, I told her I wanted nothing more from them.

However, after my visit to the Cedar Hills ULTA tonight, I felt terribly confused..The \"consultant\", a male in a full face of makeup, was very pushy and terribly lacking any knowledge of beauty. Seriously. I was trying to figure out which \"It\" makeup brush was the certain one that was on display, because I wanted to buy it and all the brushes were mixed up and half of them not where they should have been. I called him over to help me, and quickly got aggravated with him. He couldn't answer a VERY SIMPLE question, which was \"Where is 'this' brush\"??.. He kept showing me different brushes, and then telling me that you can't tell the difference between the lower budget and middle budget brushes. And, I told him that I CAN tell the difference. The brush i wanted was a mid budget one and he grabbed a lower end one and told me it was the one I was referring to from the display. I pointed out to him the difference between the one he handed me and the one I wanted and he still told me it was the same brush and there was no difference, and really everything that came out of his mouth made him sound like he totally should NOT be working at ANY beauty store. He was practically shoving this makeup brush down my throat and INSISTING that it was the brush I was looking for.. OMG really I just wanted to say something really rude to him, but I put the brush back and went to grab an Urban Decay brush instead. I would say that I don't know how he even got hired there, being so completely lost and not having the ability to just answer a very simple question..but, I think I do know how he got hired and it's probably because if they DIDN'T hire him, he could have hollered discrimination. I also want to add that almost EVERY time I've been to this ULTA location I have had one issue or another, be it not being able to get anyone to assist me, or having to deal with rude employees.

I was given Nicole, a master hair stylist. She was friendly enough, but didn't make conversation with me during my appointment and often looked at the hairstylist next to us who was telling a long story to her client. After my cut, I asked for my hair to be straightened, but then I was given a blowout with a round brush instead. Although my final hair looked great at first, it wasn't what I asked for. I left the salon and straightened my hair the next day after showering. I was horrified to find my bangs bluntly chopped with no tapering and found the layers in the back of my hair choppy and angled wrong. It essentially looked like I had holes in my hair. People even asked me if I cut my own hair. I called the manager at this Ulta, and although she eventually called me back, I had to make three calls to the salon to get her to return my phone call. I don't think all Ulta hairstylists are bad, but at this location, I found them to be lazy with their hair styling and not deserving of the \"master stylist\" designation, as well as having a lag in management.

She told me that it would not be available till 4/10 when they reset the store. Thinking I finally had the correct information, I waited patiently at the door waiting for them to open on 4/10. Before I even made it in the doors (which did not open at 11) I managed to ask the girl opening if they had any pallettes, so I wouldn't waste anymore time if they didn't. Of course she had no idea what I was talking about, so she ducked back in (closing and locking the door behind her). When she came back out she told me that they were sold out.

However a friend and I went in there last night and will most likely never go back.  My friend said she had an appointment at 4.30 to go over some smashbox products she was interested in. As we shop at Macys, Norstroms etc.we are used to going to a store and finding a lovely lady to help us out let us try it. Every time we have been in there they are always super busy so... My friend thought ahead and called and asked if she needed to \"reserve\" one of the helpful girls. She stated all she wanted to do was try on the foundation and primer and see if she liked it before spending the money on a foundation that she may not like. The woman on the phone said oh you mean a makeup lesson. My friend said well if that is what you call it then fine. The woman set the time and date. \nWe show up and I start shopping and browsing. My friend is greeted by the most wonderful lady, and they start looking at products. I browse and meet back up with my friend, the sales woman with her was helpful to me, while the other woman she called over to help me looked like she would rather be bathing a cat than to deal with me. She helped me out and I said I would need to think about what she showed me. The woman helping my friend said to go back and get a sample of what she showed me so I could actually go home and try it on my face. \nMy woman who was helping me did not want to give me a sample even after I told her that her coworker sent me over to get the sample. She eventually gave it to me. \nI continue to browse and eventually find my friend in the back. So I sit down and wait with her while the lovely woman is actually applying full makeup. \nWhen done we were told to go up to the front and she would bring the list of the things my friend was not buying right then. We hover around the front and I am looking for a lotion. We hear the announcement that the store is closing and to take all purchases up to the front.  There are a few people still checking out so we dont rush to get into line as we are still waiting for the lady to come up for the list for my friend. \nA sales woman from the front comes up to us and in the most snotty tone tells us we need to check out they are now closed and we have to leave. I have never really had a sales woman treat me like I was an idiot child with the tone that she used on us.  My friend stated that I was just looking at two things for a lotion and just found one more and just wanted to look at it for a second. That and we were awaiting a woman from the back to give a list of stuff she was going to buy in the future. She all of a sudden turned uber nice. May I point out now at this point it is really only 4 mins after closing and she was acting like we refused to leave 30 mins after closing. \nThe woman comes up and gives her the list and even runs back to get another one for me of stuff she saw me interested in. The woman stated that she got a couple of free samples and went and got 2 for her. I made the comment of yay free stuff to try and she grabbed a couple more and put them to the side and smiled. \nMy friend gets her total and it is way more than what she was planning on the week before payday.  When she asked why her total was freakishly high. The woman who was snotty to us before again turned into a very snotty person. She sighed and bent down really close to the register screen and said -well I dont know lets take a look.- She seriously acted like it was the greatest imposition to check and see if there was a mistake. \nThe sales woman said the prices for everything and then told my friend well you had a makeup lesson ..... thats $30 to teach you how to put on the makeup. My friend and I were shocked, first of all we have never and I do mean NEVER been charged by a major big makeup place to try on their makeup even if the sales rep was putting it on us like we have not been wearing makeup for more than half our lives. Second never once was she told about the price for this, not in the phone call and not once after we arrived. When my friend mentioned this to the sales rep at the counter. The sales rep again looked at us like we were misbehaving idiot children. She stated that no.... it is 30 for the makeup lesson, you had the makeup lesson therefore she was going to be charged 30. My friend said okay..... but stated to the woman that the people who make the appointments over the phone might want to clarify that to the caller who obviously didnt know. I stated that I was with her and never once was a price quoted to her. The sales woman rolled her eyes and actually took back the free samples that she had given my friend and then took away the ones she had set aside. \nMy friend paid for her purchases and I paid for mine then we left.

That's one of the drawback to them having such a vast variety of products and no exclusive items.  Most of their items can be purchased (shoplifted) at other stores and if you can't prove it to them they were purchase at their stores, they are not taking it back.  \n\nI tried to debate this with the cashier, but since it is printed on the receipt I took the item back and left the store.

I had bought 6 palettes from Makeup Revolution because I heard so many great things about them. I used one of the palettes and then I found out that they parabens in them (I should've checked out the ingredients beforehand, I know) and so I decided to return them. When I brought them up to the registers, he looked at them and tried to tell me that they didn't sell Makeup Revolution at Ulta. Like what? If Ulta doesn't sell it, did I somehow make an order in my imagination and they magically conjured up in front of me? Yes, they were fairly new products at the time but shouldn't you at least check the packing slip and the order confirmation before trying to convince me that it's not sold at Ulta?! I ended up having to explain that it was a newer product from overseas and that they had just started carrying it online.\nSo then I gave him my packing slip and order confirmation via cellphone and he asked me why I was returning the items. I told him that I had used one but had changed my mind about the others and he looked at my cousin (who was standing next to me) and started giving her these looks and rolling his eyes at me. She told me what happened afterwards and told me that she felt a little weird and uncomfortable.\nHe returned my items and I guess he checked what my total was and it didn't match up to the order confirmation. Mind you, I had purchased plenty of other items along with the 6 palettes. He asked me if I had received a discount on them... How would I know, considering he was holding my phone with the order confirmation on it? He literally stood there for a few minutes looking at it while more people in line accumulated. And he asked for someone to help him ring several times, and quite loudly. Was this some kind of plan to try and humiliate me for making a return? I don't know. But after a few minutes, he was just like \"okay.\" Thanks for wasting my phone battery. He handed me my phone back and after the return, I purchased something else. The weird part is, usually when making a return and then a purchase, most Ulta stores do it together. But he did it separately. He made the return and then he made the purchase... why? I don't understand. But anyways, I left the store with my cousin and she told me that he was giving her these weird looks and it just irritated me.\nI don't understand why making a return made him look at me like I'm some kind of scum. It didn't work. That's why you have a return policy. And this is why I try to avoid shopping at Ulta in store now. Service is awful and so is that employee.

I have found that almost EVERY store in Austin will price match the other stores in Austin, and a lot of them will even price match the on line price of the item (plus tax).\n\nAnyway, I found a few stores in Austin had the exact cologne priced at $30.00 and some online prices were even less. I took the cologne to the employee behind the cash register and asked her if they price matched their items. She quickly replied no, Ulta does not price match other stores. I informed her that Ulta's price was $40.00 more than other stores in Austin for the exact same bottle of cologne. She gave me the impression she did not care and did not even attempt to act like she cared that Ulta's price was almost twice as much than other local stores.\n\nSo needless to say, I WILL NEVER purchase cologne/perfume, or any other product for that matter, from an Ulta store knowing that they have NO interest in price matching other local stores AND that their cologne is more than twice as much In price than other stores in Austin.", "date": "2016-05-02 19:59:00"}, {"review_id": "_vZ20e1AQQ9ipb0DGUrzFg", "user_id": "ACOE1_q9qC1NW1_-VU51VA", "business_id": "yl3G5GJEm6e_ucWmWlbCuw", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is the first and only Ulta location I have ever been to.

I now regret to say that after my experience Sunday I will most likely never step foot in their store again for any reason whatsoever. Very rarely do I write this level of a review but I am pretty pissed.\n\nI received a sample from a friend of Smashbox's foundation primer and loved it but I was curious about their foundation. Before committing to a $30 purchase I was hoping to, at least, try out the foundation with the primer and such. Everytime I go in to Ulta and am curious to try something I am unable to find someone free to help me so I thought if I called and made an appointment with a sales person or something I could actually try on the foundation or have them give me tips as to putting on that particular foundation. The woman said, \"oh you want a makeup lesson\"...I said, \"ok, if that is what you call it\". So she scheduled me for the next day with someone. I have done this same thing numerous times at Macys, Nordstrom...you name it - half the time they will do a full makeover on you if they have time or at least use the product you want and go over it with you. \n\nI showed up early and was a touch confused since it seemed super thorough and she was offering to use other products too that she recommends and giving me water to drink etc - it was really sweet even though my eye makeup was fairly scary. I was grateful I purposely scheduled nothing major for the evening - just dinner with my friend who went with me and honestly I was just afraid of my eye makeup and anxious to get home to take the stuff off my face. I did like the colors and laughed with her even that I would apply them MUCH differently but figured we were just playing around so I could see the different makeup and such.\n\nThen I was wandering slowly to the counter and waiting for her list of products the we went over and such like she asked. This is when the horror show began. First, a very rude woman marched up talking to me and my friend like we were small children saying, \"Ladies, we are closing so you need to go to the counter and make your purchases\" in an excessively snotty tone...ummm wow... I said my friend was trying to find a lotion and she just marched right up to the register demaning we join her...so we put down the lotion she was looking at and followed. This was the first time I have had a bouncer kick me out of a store when I am trying to buy more. We were trying to explain that we were waiting for the girl helping us and such and suddenly she was nice for a few moments saying I got free samples and such which was nice. She rang up everything and asked if I wanted to tip the girl helping me. I did not know they could take tips but sure! So I said $10...at which point I saw the total and nearly fainted...they were charging me $30 freaking dollars for a girl to go over foundations with me....I said, \"Um, excuse me but I did not get a facial\" and she explained that makeup lessons cost money. When I baulked about it that I was never told by a single person they would charge me for this -SERIOUSLY I WOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT THE DAMNED FOUNDATION FOR $30!!!!!!!!!! I mean really....REALLY!!!??? They she got extremely nasty when I asked her to remove a few items (since I was not prepared for this huge bill). She even silently took away my free samples! I kept explaining that not a single person said a word about this \"fee\" - seriously, next time I will just go to a high end store where they do not treat me like dirt for wanting to actually have a person to show me a product before I make the purchase. I will say the girl who did my makeup was very sweet and knowlegeable - it is tragic the rest of the people who work there are apparently complete morons. I might also mention that on their actual \"salon services\" menu that they gave me it does not say anything whatsoever about a \"makeup lesson\" - just \"makeup application\" and I was NOT ready to roll looking fabu - seriously, had I known I was being charged $30 plus tip for her to actually apply my makeup, believe me - I would have actually had somewhere to go after AND she would have redone it because I would not have gone out in public looking like that!", "date": "2012-03-26 17:07:49"}, {"review_id": "Z1ICWEZ8D2Pk0TWz_C9c8w", "user_id": "6usUcbrIA9tYPNoiR4sgfw", "business_id": "yl3G5GJEm6e_ucWmWlbCuw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I would not recommend the make up and hair salon.

I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of getting really sick, getting put on antibiotics, feeling better for a short time and then getting sick all over again. \n\nAnd to make a ridiculously long, painful and frustrating medical story short, it wasn't until I came to Austin and got very sick that I saw Dr. Gilbey and they found the root cause of my medical problems. I was diagnosed with an atypical Cystic Fibrosis, something that is pretty rare. If he had not so tirelessly looked for answers, then we never would've figured it out. When I saw him, I was down to 88lbs and getting seriously ill every 3-4 months. I was losing weight, missing work, exhausted, out of breath and in general frustrated. He did every test he could and didn't stop until he had the answer. And now that he has it, his treatment has been proactive and consistent. He is excellent about explaining things to me like I am a human being and for the first time in ten years, I am finally feeling much better. \n\nIn addition, in at least one instance for me in dealing with insurance and hospital policy hell, he went above and beyond what is expected of a doctor.

I got en estimate but was told to go in to get an exact prize. So I show up and some guy Gerald assists me supposedly a master color tech he gave me an exact quote of $146+tax.

Well after being there 6 hours I'm exhausted and the smell of chemicals have gotten to me and I was hungry. After 6 long hours he comes to me and checks my foil and says\"it's not as bright I wanted but oh well\".then we wash and put gloss and wash again. I went in with dark brown hair and because he did dark auburn highlights you can't see them and now I'm very unhappy. I paid because I signed a form before getting my hair dyed.

He looked at me like I was screwing up his day by just being there at the counter. I told him that I had an appointment with Ashley & again, I got a look. He proceeds to tell me that Ashley doesn't work on Thursdays.  I told him that I had personally spoken with her and she's the one who made the appointment..... he again, argued with me that it wasn't possible, b/c she never works on Thursday. Then he says he can maybe get me in with another gal, but that she's an \"elite stylist\" so it would be higher ($280 / that's a $145 DIFFENCE). She came over and began looking at my hair to see how she could possibly do it for the original quoted price- then she realized that she didn't have enough of the purple that I wanted so it couldn't be done unless I wanted to settle for another color.... oh- AND because of how thick my hair was, it was going to be at least $190- which, btw, my stylist only charges me $120) REALLY???

She charges $54 and I don't know why. A stylist at Supercuts could've probably done a better job. I was too upset to even talk to her. It was noticeable, though. After she got it completely wrong the 2nd time she asked if I wanted someone else to cut my hair. Any more hair off would have resulted in a pixie cut which is what I did not want. If you go ask for Celina but stay far far away from Sharyl. Oh and nobody offered to remedy the situation. I payed $54 for a butchered cut.

The appointment took around 3 1/2 hrs, she definitely took her time and I appreciated that. Another client of hers showed up when my hair was almost done processing, so she had to attend to her. Fortunately, Sheryl was available and she offered to take over and finish me up (shampoo and blowout), which was extremely generous of her. Sheryl was also very thorough and kind and made sure I was comfortable the whole time, even though I was not her client. \n\nMy experience at Ulta salon was amazing and it exceeded my expectations. Leena has only been there a couple of days so I figured I'd shout her out so people know to book her!!

On Monday, I got a voicemail from them saying they needed to move my appointment from 1:45 to 2. No problem for me since it was only a 15 minute difference. I called them to confirm that 2 was fine. The girl on the phone was very sweet and said they looked forward to seeing me on Tuesday at 2. \n\nJust 4 hours before my appointment today, a girl from Ulta called me saying they wouldn't be able to fit me in. She blamed it on the fact that the appointment was made online and the stylist didn't have enough time to do such a large service. I explained that the appointment had already been moved and it was confirmed by the salon and by text days before. She insisted there wasn't enough time. \n\nI realize mistakes happen, but the way it was handled was extremely poor. To call me the day of to cancel right before a holiday is unacceptable. I could understand if the stylist was out sick or something but she had no reasonable excuse. She was hardly apologetic and even got a little short with me at one point even though I kept my cool with her. She could've apologized and offered to do part of my service like maybe a few highlights instead of a full and a quick trim but she offered nothing. Perhaps a discount on a rescheduled appointment? Nope. Nothing. I'm totally bummed I won't have my hair done for Thanksgiving. I know it's just hair and I'll live, but the way this situation was handled was awful. \n\nI sure hope the manager reaches out to me to salvage the situation so I can return as a customer.

I had booked the appointments through the app, which said it would take 2 hours 30 mins for the partial highlights, cut and style and 40 mins for the makeup. The estimated cost was to be $200. When greeted by the stylist (Irene), she told me I would need full highlights. I instructed her that I wanted my hair to be belayage, and that I needed to be finished by 4:30pm (including makeup)I said ok to the full highlights, trusting her judgement (but she did not tell me how much extra money it would cost or time it would take). She began the service at 1pm, then proceeded to leave bleach in my hair with just the lower section of my hair done for about an hour while she finished another client. At this stage I was ready to walk out, and was extremely unhappy with the service. Next, she did not mention about needing a root touch up until she was half way through bleaching my hair, then I asked if she could touch up and she did that for me. By this time, 3 hours had gone by, she washed out the bleach and toned it, then told the makeup girl that she had to leave now, as her shift was over (4pm) and she would have to take over cutting, styling and applying my makeup. I said to cancel the makeup and just get my hair done, as it was still wet and still needed to be cut and styled. The makeup artist then cut my hair by picking up random pieces of hair and snipping them with scissors, then blow dryed my already fried hair from the overdeveloped bleach application without a heat protectant.

As many will see from my reviews, I'm a pretty even-kilt reviewer and oftentimes very generous in my comments, suggesting that I would be nothing less than fair in this review.\n\nThe first issue that I have overall with Ulta stores is the lack of customer service and the apparent lack of cultural diversity training. I can count on one hand, the number of times that I've gone into an Ulta establishment, only to be left wandering around the store looking for products without any greeting or assistance from their staff. On two occasions, the staff were gathered on the floor collectively, talking amongst themselves, and never acknowledging customers. Sadly, I called the store and spoke with a less than interested manager who attempted to cover or justify their poor level of performance.  Makes sense though...leading by example.\n\nOn my most recent visits, I had one Sales rep look at me like I was crazy because I was exchanging some products that were purchased as a gift. Nothing unheard of right? Well, she provided some BS excuse of why I couldn't exchange or do a store credit without the receipt or having the customers Points Reward info....Viola!!!! I produce the receipt via phone with the barcode and her story changes.  You know that feeling when someone is telling a boldface lie to you??? Yeap! Me too. That's what I got from this sales lady rep who really didn't want to be bothered. But, being the bigger and more professionally competent person that I am, told her I would get the receipt from the person who purchased the products that live in NC.\n\nSo, with receipt in tow, three days afterwards, another Sales lady person stands at the counter, and when I politely hand her the products (because I think its rude and disrespectful to put stuff on the counter as though the person is diseased), looked at me like I was crazy. Not  sure why....(i think my Yelp profile pics are pretty darn cute).  So I'm immediately wandering if there was a form of Leprosy appearing on my body. Nevertheless, I give her the spill from my previous experience at the same location, showed her the receipt, and....(wait for it)...   SHE BARELY GLANCED AT IT! So all the talk from the other rep was a bunch of garbage and an attempt to get out of doing her job and be a difficult employee.  Nevertheless, I have a store credit but I'm so not interested in shopping in this store.\n\nIf anyone from the leadership team of Ulta is assigned to reviewing customer dissatisfaction, this review is for you. Better yet, I own and run a Coaching and Management firm in which we train organizations, corporations, and individuals on customer relations and etiquette. My belief is that this level of training is not reaching general employees but may be happening on a larger level of Ulta because it's not coincidental that this experience has taken place in separate locations.\n\nNo offense but Sephora and other beauty counters are way more user-friendly. \n\nTwo thumbs up...Not", "date": "2016-05-16 20:53:11"}, {"review_id": "iz7d5nvCU-JvhPOM_WMGcg", "user_id": "qHJu6jQvA0rQ1mEffrG_QA", "business_id": "yl3G5GJEm6e_ucWmWlbCuw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I came here for some fragrances, and my friends and I were harassed by the staff under the assumption we were going to steal.

I had always been interested in the salon services that Ulta has. So, I decided to check the hours they were open.  To my surprise the website said they were open til 9pm!\n\nI called at 6:15pm on a Saturday and got an appointment for 7pm same day.  I was excited.  I read some of the reviews and then was not as excited.  I went anyways.  \n\nI arrived right at 7pm.  The girl working the reception desk was on the phone, but didn't make any gesture to politely acknowledge my presence. She kept talking for about 4 minutes and I quietly waited.  After she got off the phone, I informed her I was there for my appointment.  She stated she would tell the stylist and to have a seat.  She wasn't as friendly as a receptionist should be, but whatever she's a receptionist.  In the grand scheme of things, she doesn't really matter- the stylist does. \n\nI looked around at all the products and then took a seat.  I was greeted by an enthusiastic sytlist and he brought me a bottle of water as I waited.  He told me it would be a few minutes and apologized.  \n\nThe stylist I had was named Sean.  He had long, curly hair, tats and piercings.  I had seen the client he just finished with and she looked great.  I was excited.  \n\nSean was very friendly, open, and talkative.  He used Redken shampoo/conditioner.  He and I discussed what I was looking for in a cut.  \n\nNow, people with curly hair know EXACTLY how challenging getting a cut can be.  Most hair books are for straight hair or that \"perm perfect\" curly hair.  People with REAL curls/waves know that our ringlets are unpredictable.  \n\nHe gave me two different options for cuts.  I went with the latter.  He made my hair longer in the back, with a subtle v.  In the front it was shorter and framed my face a bit.  Lots of layers.  He used Redkin curl product and used an infuser and viola! I loved my hair!  \n\nIt was fun, easy, and just what I wanted!  The shampoo/cut/style was $36.

Only, when I left I didn't see it better, it was darker than the color I came in with.

She tried to justify it by saying the hair will not look the same as the celeb since their stylist is different but she had tried. I'm sure the look on my face said it all.

I went into this store with a HUGE smile on my face and was only greeted by a surly security guard. No big deal, I thought, and headed in. There were at least 5 women behind the check out counter even though there was no one waiting to pay. None of them acknowledged me. I walked through the cheaper eyeliners and makeups just to see if there were any super deals but there was literally NO STOCK AT ALL. Everything was just empty! All the samples looked like children had been playing in them for months. A TOTAL MESS!! I was a little disappointed but figured there was no way they let their higher end makeup get like that. I walked over to the Anastasia Beverly Hills display and surprise, surprise! A TOTAL MESS! Only half stocked. Same with Urban Decay and Smashbox. Just a mess everywhere and almost no stock. I looked around for someone to help me. There was an employee staring in a mirror doing her own makeup. I stood there for a moment but she didn't even look up. I walked around some more and tried to ask another employee a question. She saw me and literally turned the other way. I looked over at the makeup counter and saw an employee providing a color match on a woman with a dark complexion. The employee had completely mismatched this poor woman and was arguing with her that if she \"just blended\" it would \"work\". Only took 5 minutes to burst my excited makeup bubble. Then I turned around and realized... The security guard was closely following my every move. There was a gaggle of screaming teenagers running around but he was worried about me stealing their NONEXISTENT high end stock. Maybe if they had a knowledgeable professional employee actually answering my questions then they wouldn't have to have security follow me around and I would have actually bought something. I just walked out of this disaster of a store empty handed and pretty pissed off.

I called and my insurance said they could have called the number they gave me and that I shouldn't have had to call. Okay. \n\nI come in to my appointment. Rebecca greets me and is annoyed that I did not fill out the paperwork prior to my visit. Alright. She then informs me that because I did not call her BACK with my insurance findings I would be responsible for the entire cost of my visit. I told her I reached out to my insurance as she requested and she said, \"I'm very busy here answering the phone and greeting patients so I probably won't be able to call your insurance today. So you'll have to pay the full amount.\" I informed her that I have seen several other specialists and physicians here and they had no problem contacting my insurance. I then asked her to politely call. She said she couldn't make any promises. I'm sorry -- that's your JOB. The way which she treated me thereafter is something I have NEVER experienced at a doctor's office!\n\nShe then called my insurance and said I would be responsible for a part of the visit although I later confirmed with my insurance that was NOT the case. I don't even think she called my insurance. \n\nI later told the doctor about this situation and he apologized and then began to tell me some personal details about the receptionist's life and said she's going through some personal family stuff. I felt so uncomfortable this entire time I don't even know what was happening here. \n\nAfter my appointment I was informed that my insurance does in fact cover the visit. However, I received a bill for the full amount a week after the visit. I had to call them AGAIN and straighten everything out. \n\nThis entire debacle completely marred my opinion of this practice. Helpful and friendly front desk staff is essential to any service or physician's office and I was frankly shocked to receive such poor service and lack of politeness. I would highly recommend you going to one of the other allergist offices in Atlanta to avoid being interrogated and embarrassed because a front desk person has the inability to google an insurance number. \n\nTL;DR: IF YOU ARE FROM OUT OF STATE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.", "date": "2017-09-12 20:45:56"}, {"review_id": "NLxCsARQhMxmrZgtG4cw2g", "user_id": "B5o5qamnRRyd3AhRxJMW5A", "business_id": "D9RuYLNrtb6LBYLGiSxJQQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Solomon is now at Glow Drybar in Buckhead!", "date": "2013-10-08 20:54:32"}, {"review_id": "NtUImkE9xcHt4LKdZFTKdw", "user_id": "0o1AQQ9kaAbmdezKdi5YLA", "business_id": "D9RuYLNrtb6LBYLGiSxJQQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I have bought men's cologne from here in the past and if I'm in the area I will stop in and see what they have and to just try out new scents.

Before this time, women did not generally work outside of the home, and young women certainly did not leave their rural homesteads to head for the industrializing cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Parents freaked, the kids were possibly not alright (they might have been wearing shorter skirts and... gasp, entertaining gentlemen in their apartments!), and the term \"shop girl\" emerged. \n\nUlta, which is a beauty supply store that I frequented often and enthusiastically when I lived in Chicago, reminds me exactly of this period and the \"shop girl.\" Not as posh as Sephora, with a mix of both high end/designer and drug store- level cosmetics and beauty supplies, Ulta is often staffed by workin' girls who are much more fin-de-siecle NYC department store than Nordstrom-at-Easton. And this, I like so much better than trying to be helped by those fluff-for-brains unhelpful Sephora chicks. Sorry ladies. \n\nI was excited to see that Ulta opened up in Cbus - I haven't been to the Easton location, but since the Polaris one is not in the mall, I have been to this one at least five times in the past couple months. True to my lower-class origins, yes, I have been spending my hard earned money on Urban Decay, Philosophy, and other creature comforts. This is what I love so much about the concept of Ulta - it's not snotty, it's sexy in an almost working class way. An \"I want to be a candy striper when I grow up\" way. I teach this in my women's studies course as \"the Cosmo Girl discourse.\" And no, I do not read Cosmopolitan (well, okay... sometimes I do...). :D \n\nYeah, this store isn't well stocked... several items I have looked for have been out of stock on numerous occasions. In fact, ALL of the Urban Decay products I was looking for last time I was in were not available... however, the shop girls ;) are very nice and helpful, and told me when to come back if I wanted to buy them. Kinda a pain since I HATE the suburbs, but since the Lakeview Chicago Ulta wasn't usually understocked, I'll chock this up to newness and inexperience in Columbus. \n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Ulta if you love makeup and fashion (they also do hair cutting and styling and eyebrow waxing, but I can't attest to those things since I don't go to Ulta for those services) but aren't a mallrat, suburban foo', or a snotty rich lady or gentleman.

Ulta is a chain of beauty stores, kind of like a Sephora but more bare-bones, definitely less glamorous, and equipped with a brow bar, hair salon, and a mini no-frills Dermalogica spa. Prices were sort of high but comparable to Sephora prices. I expected a lot more help/service but it was very much do your own thing, figure out for yourself here. I didn't have anyone come up to me to offer help, and I had to ask the hair dresser and the aesthetician questions - somewhat like pulling teeth, whereas I expect people to try to make a sale. Dermalogica facials seem no frill, don't expect a spa atmosphere, but the facials are affordable. I'm not a Dermalogica fan and was turned off by the unsanitary conditions at the 'spa.' I asked the hair dresser how much a trim would be, and it seemed super over priced. Anyhow, nice to have this place here as competition for Sephora.

However, I was bummed to learn they don't carry Iman products. The one in Beaverton does. It upset me because the new Sephora's downtown also doesn't carry Iman. It's a makeup/skincare line geared towards African-American women/women of color. It's insulating enough Sephora's downtown doesn't carry it, but Lloyd Center has mostly folks of color clientele. Why doesn't this Ulta carry more women of color makeup? It's frustrating and annoying that as a dark skinned black woman, I can't walk into a store full of makeup products, and walk out with anything (I'm talking about foundations/powder). I think they aren't carrying these products because they stereotype black women as thieves. Why do I have to order Iman online or go way out to Beaverton (as suggested by the SA), when there is an Ulta right in my neighborhood? Blah. The one good thing this store does carry Carol's Daughter, natural hair products for African-American women.

I have used Pain Management 3 times in the last 12 years for relief of temporary pain. My first introduction to Ashok Jayaram, MD was just over 10 years ago when I had a serious accident with a Radial Arm saw and cut my left hand (Primary hand) in half and  loosing 2 of my fingers. After a 8 1/2 hour surgery they had my hand back together. Over the next 2 years I had 13 additional surgeries. The surgeon was good about treating the pain resulting from the surgery but did nothing to help my suffering from the nerve damage and 2 years of hand therapy. They referred me back to my primary care doctor who did nothing. While complaining to my surgeon about the issue he referred me to Pain Management. Dr Jayaram immediately put me on a long lasting fentanyl patch and a lidocaine patch which worked great. After completing therapy we went to strictly to the lidocaine patch which I used for the next 18 months or so until the nerve pain disappeared. This was a wonderful non narcotic pain solution.\nFast forward 10 years to my knee surgery (total replacement). The surgery went very well and they treated me for 6 weeks. At that point they discontinued all pain medication which caught me off guard. I was still in therapy ( which is very, very painful) and still in a lot of discomfort. Back to Pain Management Consultants. Dr Jayaram Put me back on a Fentanyl patch temporarily until my insurance approved the use of a formulated cream for pain management. This was a godsend. It worked great. So off the patch and on to the cream. I still use it today.\n\nRecently, I had a bungy cord (black rubber with metal hook) come undone while fully extended and hit me directly in the right eye rupturing the eye, crushing the lens, detaching the retina, and tearing my iris in half. The ophthalmologist  treated the for the initial pain but due to the trauma to the eye and optic nerve, I developed Ocular Migraines. Back to Pain Management. Dr Jayaram put me on oral medication while we got insurance approval for a special treatment. Yesterday, he treated me with a local analgesic applied through the nose. It absorbs through the sinus and into a nerve cluster behind the eye. Instant relief ! It lasted about 3.5 hours. At about 2 am I was awakened by a screaming headache. I applied the treatment and bingo, headache gone.

I even asked if I could do two separate transactions or leave and come back to pay for the 5th, to which she replied no. I explained these were gifts for my 5 bridesmaids. It did not matter. She said they don't allow it because people resell them. I left without the products and they lost a $125 sale. I checked online and you can order up to quantities of 10 so they really are not stopping anyone from reselling. Plus, who cares if someone turns around and resells an item? They paid for it at your store, the sale is done and it's no longer your problem.

It's not with the store itself - it's with their Brow Bar.\n\nHere's the deal: my mom is a member of the Ulta rewards program.  Therefore, she has a card, gets points and gets their spam in her email box.  Well, this month happened to be her birthday and Ulta gave her a free brow wax on her birthday month.  Thing is, she doesn't need to get brows waxed (she complains she doesn't have enough brows to wax - wish we all had that problem) so she passed the email along to me.\n\nI printed it out, made an appointment and walked in yesterday all ready to be waxed and plucked.  As I explained the deal to my waxer Delores, she asked to see the print out and then my license.  I showed her and she questioned my birthdate (which is in March).  When I told her my mom had forwarded the email to me to use in her stead, she said she had to check to see if it was legal.  After whispering in the back of the store with one of her cohorts and looking like they were consulting about something of national security she returned saying they couldn't honor it.  Seriously?!?\n\nAt this point, I asked how much a regular waxing would cost - answer: $20.  I could go to a Yelp approved salon with a private room and professional waxer *cough*Carter Barnes Phipps*cough, cough* for less!  With a less than pleased \"Forget it,\" I was back out the door.

My appt was at 3:15 and sat waiting until around 3:45. I booked an all over color but in the middle of coloring without consent Vincent brings an additional bowl of color and informs me there is a charge of $12.?? for additional color. He apparently decided to pull streaks of color for dimension he stated which was never discussed. Then the absolute worst part was the shampooing which I was praying to end. He kept spraying water directly in my ears and the back of my shirt was soaked. He offered cotton for my ears but what good would that have done except to have wet cotton in my ears. I asked for a towel and held it there in both ears shivering from the cold water he was spraying everywhere. O my. Then on to the cut. I was more than happy with my current cut and only wanted the dead ends trimmed. He did what he wanted anyways and put more layering in my hair. On to blow-dryer which he kept blowing with the tip on directly in my ears. My hair was still slightly damp and everywhere when he breaks out the round brush. I told him I had gotten rid of a lot of length last time I was there with Tonya and Id prefer it to be straightened instead of curled under. He informed me that was a 10 dollar additional fee and he could do it after he round brushed it. I told him just do it how he wanted it since that was how he was going to do it anyways. I sat there a few more minutes becoming more discontent with the entire situation when I just said stop. He said it didnt look finished and I said I didnt care. He put the round brush down and began straightening it like I asked to begin with. At the end, I walk away with a 139 dollar salon trip. Is there no such thing as a charge for a trim rather than a full haircut? And who authorized the additional color? I left my protein cup there and Im so upset that I wont go back for it. I will never go back in that store the rest of my life. I want a refund for services. It was never about what I wanted only what he wanted instead.

I was friendly towards the entire staff. Every visit I brought the staff treats. Cookies, cupcakes or even ice cream sandwiches in the summer time. I've bought gifts for a few of the staff as well. I have had many procedures done throughout the time I was his patient. The last two procedures I had were very painful and took a long time to heal. I decided to have no further procedures done. \nOver the past two years, my insurance has paid for most of the costs of these procedures with the exception of $1.50 here or $5.00 here. All my procedures had added up to around $100.00. About six months ago I paid $30.00 on it leaving a balance of $70.00. \nAfter telling them I wasn't going to have any more procedures things changed. I went in for my visit. I was told I couldn't check in until the person in the billing department ok'ed it. I spoke to her and informed her I couldn't afford to pay anything on the bill at this time.   \n(I ALWAYS paid my copay) She said she would have to go speak to Dr. Jayaram to see if he would see me today since I wasn't paying on my bill. I was in tears back sitting in the waiting room. I was afraid he was not going to see me and not fill my pain medication and I have Multiple Sclerosis and have a lot of pain. She came back saying he was in a procedure so she couldn't talk to him right now. She was going to let me be seen. I went back out to the lobby to check in and pay my copay. She told the receptionist it was ok to check me in. The receptionist asked her loudly \"is she only paying her copay\"? She then says to the receptionist \"I don't know\"?  I said I already told you I could be pay anything else! I was currently going through an eviction and had no extra money. I said you guys are acting like I owe you $7,000 instead of $70.00. \nI was so upset at the way I was treated. I was embarrassed, humiliated and couldn't understand why this money seemed to be so dire all the sudden. \nAfter I was home I called my insurance company and filed a grievance with them. No doctor should ever treat a patient like this. I received call a few days later from the doctor's office. They were calling to inform me that if I didn't set a date to pay the $70.00 the doctor would terminate care. I set up a date within 10 days to pay the $70.00. She said that would be ok. \nIn today's mail dated the SAME day they called me to make arrangements to pay my bill. The doctor \"FINDS IT NECESSARY TO WITHDRAW FROM FURTHER PROFESSIONAL CARE\"! \nI thought about it and know it all makes sense. I told them I was no longer going to have any more procedures done. This is where the doctor makes his money. He doesn't make as much money from  a patient who just comes in for medication. I stopped being a money making patient! Therefore he had to drop me like a bad habit! It's sad but I guess it's clear that Dr. Ashok Jayaram is all about the money. You're a great patient as long as you are willing to be a pincushion for him so he can get richer.

Most think they can, get into my hair, end up cutting away to oblivion. Because I have SO much hair, stylist end up running out of time and rush my color.... Real talk, Ive been flying to Miami Beach for years to have my hair attended to and spend $$$$$ for the talent....im thrilled to have found Selena and no longer need too! \n1) She spent at least a half an hour discussing what I wanted before even beginning! I mean, who does that?! \n2) attention to detail, took her time cutting ny hair, its layered perfectly \n3) color is multiple shades of cool blond and its gorgeous, almost as if its natural \n4) i waited two week to post my review just to be sure i could replicate what she did at home.\nAND I CAN! \nGuys!!!! Go see her! Dont write off \"ulta salon?really?\" \nShe is a diamond and im beyond pleased!", "date": "2020-01-11 17:11:53"}, {"review_id": "wBmiJ6fAC8WSq4bQuAKG5g", "user_id": "U4jkM_FwL2Tl_jgst9pjGA", "business_id": "bTdOMfM1Lxa7reSi2C4Akw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Amanda is amazing!!

I am not one to bad mouth or write a horrible review but since this happened to my 13 year old I felt compelled as a mother.\n\nWe went in around 5:30 for both my 11 and 13 year old to get trims. The minute Diane took our information in the computer I knew it was going to be a problem. She was cracking random jokes trying to be silly with the kids. She asked my toughest what her name was and had a sigh of releif because her name wasn't spelled with extra letters in it like some of the name out there today. How rude!!! She was complaining about the computer software and seemed annoyed. It was funny for all about 2 minutes, then I started to get concerned that this whack job would cut their hair. She said the kids were the last cuts of her day. Her jokes were just uncalled for.\n\nShe took my oldest back to the chair to look at her hair. She took it out of her top knot and let her hair down. THE MINUTE my daughter let her hair down- started the condescending almost insulting comments. Now my daughter are biracial and my 13 year old has long curly course hair. Dianes facial expressions and remarks were shaming. She asked when the last time her cut was and what she wanted to do. She asked if she wore it down or in THAT bun on her head all the time.\n\nMy oldest wanted long layers but wanted to keep it long. She wears it down and curled to school. Diane offered to do a \"Diva Cut\". For me I am not familiar to the hair stylist lingo so I asked, what's that?. SHE TOLD ME TO LOOK IT UP ON MY PHONE. I think I was stunned and she definitely seen my reaction, she said, oh no, I'm not trying to be rude but I can't really explain it to you. YOU CANT EXPLAIN IT TO ME??? How is this supposed to make the client feel comforted. I was worried. We went back and forth with what my daughter wanted and I felt unsettled even still. She took her over to the sink to wash and came back to the chair.\n\nShe sits down and throws the towel at the mirror and says, I'm pissed right now! I look at my daughters brand new Nike sweatshirt and there is RED HAIR DYE ALL OVER THE BACK AND ON HER NECK. I said what is that? She said, my coworker did a color and didn't clean the sink! I was about to LOSE IT.\n\nI ask to speak to the manager- She said I am the salon manager-( JUST MY LUCK!!!) I said okay, Where is YOUR manager. She said my general manager Jessica is here.\n\nI wait 5 minutes for Jessica. During that time, Diane is saying things like, This is a free haircut, There is a stain remover you can buy at Target, etc. The \naudacity!\n\nJessica come over and from the look on her face, this may have not been the first time something like this has happened. She DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE PROPER COMPASSION. Just turns away, walking towards the office saying, I'll be right back I need to make sure I handle this properly with all the facts. For a minute I thought by the general manager coming over that I would feel better about things but no.\n\nShe comes back out and says, I will print you out an in store claim and corporate will handle it. I said, Handle it? What does that mean. She said whether to dry clean or not.\n\nShe barely even walked over to look at my child's damaged shirt! I took pictures and told my daughter to get up and we are leaving. Sadly there will be no hair cut today. \n\nDiane snarled and said, you know I'm a good hair stylist right? As she is brushing my daughters soaking wet hair. I said I am sure you are but this didn't start the way it should have. \n\nShe then said you know I felt attacked by you. WHATTT? I said, I am sorry you felt that way but you are ultra unprofessional and had NO EXPLANATION to the type of cut for my daughter, do you expect me to agree with whatever you are saying then have something go wrong and my child hate her hair cut? I am making the call and we are leaving.\n\nIt's not even about the stained sweatshirt. That's material things. It's about the way we felt and the lack of professionalism. We felt very uncomfortable. I shop thee regularly and spend a lot of money on makeup and products ya for my family. We should have had a easy going conversation about it. It just seemed like it was the end of her day and was too big of job to deal with. Who knows\n\nI expect corporate to follow up with me and handle proper compensation. They just lost two hair cut sales today and more sales if they I will not be shopping at the Everett location anymore.\n\nMy girls thanked me and were proud of the way I handled it. Never stoop to the level of ignorant people. I really feel like she thought my daughter texture of her hair was repulsive and an annoyance to her. She clearly didn't know what to do with it clearly. She didn't make my daughter feel comfortable, beautiful or confident. I am always going to be an advocate for my child. Speak up when things don't feel right.

The woman, \"Kayla\" I think it was, dramatically dyed orange red bright hair, with a lot of faux freckles. I wish she was as helpful as she was cute. She shut me down with yes or no questions without a pertinent next option that might work for me instead. Or even where else TO get that if i was unmovable on the subject. Also, she rushed, and reminded, and badgered me about the time and when they were closing and then leave me\nTo fend on my own. She seemed really unhappy, inconvenienced by my presence e, the fact the store was closing, and that I really just need a few second of her time to help speed purge processso I cannot. Leave since  her smile was saying GTFO. So I made quick, ill equipped decisions while being rushed, I told the cash register lady that I wanted to keep a few of the items because I was using a gift card from my birthday, and in my flusteresstateshearl managed to charge me cash instead of my\nGift card and at least paying enough attention to me and my needs as the one customer in front of her to not make me come back AGAIN, tomorrow, to gosh damn it fix the whole shit show.

Probably not. Kayla, Kyra, whatever the young woman's name is might've had a bad day or something else,BUT, we all live through the good and the bad. And the beauty of customer service is we get to stand behind a field or Products we stand behind and we get to interact and share that excitement or give them knowledge they came in without, and create something meaningful out of what one might consider a blaze.

I discovered that this location is open amid construction of other stores/restaurants (AMC, Chipotle, Starbucks, Gyu Kaku, Nike, LOFT). \n\nThe store is bright, large and very well organized. I went on a quiet Tuesday afternoon so there were few customers inside. This store is very new so all of the displays and testers were fresh, undisturbed, and frankly pristine condition. All of the sales associates were friendly and welcoming. \n\nFor those who don't know, one major difference between Ulta and Sephora is that Ulta carries drugstore brands and high-end brands. It was cool to see lines like Covergirl and Soap & Glory near Urban Decay and Too Faced.\n\nThings I love:\n\n- They have MAC cosmetics! Sephora doesn't carry MAC so this is a huge plus.\n- I found a small display section for Morphe. They have the Jaclyn Hill palette in stock! And of course, a few of their brushes.\n- Extremely approachable and helpful sales associates! One offered to color match me for foundation and another shared the lastest Mario Badescu face mist scent (lavender). \n\nAs a Sephora VIB Rouge status member, I'm pretty excited that Ulta is so accessible and maybe be earning part of my beauty budget. I signed up for Ulta's reward program right away when I heard that they give you $$ off your future purchases as rewards in lieu of Sephora's deluxe samples. \n\nNote - they don't carry Laura Mercier, Marc Jacobs, or Make Up Forever cosmetics. However, there is a TON of overlapping make-up lines so it's worthwhile to come into the store. I was pleasantly surprised to find Dermalogical products here.\n\nThere is huge service area here. I didn't try that day but you can get hair, nail, make-up, and waxing services here. Pretty cool. \n\nOnce this section of South Bay is fully up and running, I can see this store turning into a zoo.

It turns out, someone had broken the nozzle off ( it was just an open bottle) and then put the top back on.   Needless to say I panicked because it stung.  I walked up to the cash wrap and asked a girl if she could help me. She proceeded to ask another lady ( manager) for the eye wash. The manager nonchalantly pointed towards the back of the store.  Never even acknowledging but looked right at me.  Me, still in a panic just ran towards this sink near the hair area and rinsed my face/neck off again and again. About a minute later the girl came over with the eyewash. I told her none got in my eye but that it stung my face, neck etc. she just stood there with with not one speck of empathy. Minutes later I saw the manager walk by. Second time now She looked over and never asked \"are you ok\" nothing\u203c.  I honestly felt so horrible. My feelings were hurt above everything because it's as if I was doing something wrong. I am Always uplifting to ppl and genuinely caring so it's so hard to swallow that two women who look like me could be so cold and just nonchalant.  I told the sales girl that I'll show her the fragrance so that it doesn't happen to anyone else (Important)... I go back over to the fragrance and wait and nobody comes?!?! They didn't give af.

That problem was never solved - possibly a side effect of meds I'm on - but I was diagnosed with narcolepsy.  I did have trouble staying awake in the afternoon, but I hardly expected this.  It was not likely I had apnea as I'm slim and don't have bad sinus issues or allergies. And I did not.\n\nAnyways, I ended up with this diagnosis and a Rx for meds to take during the day to keep me awake.  They worked fine.  I went to the doc once a year for a refill check up.  Then the standard treatment changed - to a highly regulated drug I took at night to get excellent sleep.  It worked great, too - better than taking something when I got tired.  With this I didn't get tired in the first place.  \n\nThings were going swimmingly until the office started not returning the refill requests in a timely manner or otherwise being responsive.  So I would go without meds while the Rx company waited for authorization.  Or the insurance company waited to hear back from the doctor's office.  \n\nAnd then the regulators allegedly made it so I had to go to see the doc not annually - but with every 3 month refill.  The problems here became both the cost (I have a high deductible plan so I pay full price out of pocket for every office visit) - and the office's timeliness.  One visit, after waiting 40 minutes to get called back from the waiting room, I got up and left as I just ran out of time and needed to go to my next appointment.  AND THEY WERE SURPRISED!  Now - my visit literally goes as quickly as they can push me through - like 5 minutes total of their time is what it would take - not that I even really need to be seen.\n\nI have found a time (right after lunch) - that seems to minimize my wait time.

(Honestly, my hair was a bit of a mess from a previous stylist who gave strange layers and highlights.) \n\nFirst, she did do a good job with color, however I did not really like the red undertones when I really wanted dark brown. I wish she had shown me some hair swatches of the shade. \n\nThe cut was the issues. She created even more strange layers.  When I curl my hair, I know look like I have a Jane Fonda 70's wing curl! When I corrected the stylist at the end because the cut did not look complete, and my bangs were no where near where I wanted them, she started texturizing, but not the other.... and I asked for swooping bangs, like the ones in my picture of my hair a year before... NOPE, I got \"bangs\" that had bangs!   I let her finish, paid and went home crying. I called the salon the next day to complain, and they did offer to let her try to fix it for free, but no way I would let her near my hair with scissors again!\n  \n\nAt least, I got cute ponytail holders at ulta on my way out that night\n\n( update: went to another salon to see what they could do... I was informed that my cut is considered a southern mullet and it will take several months for it to be fix since it's so bad... even the hairstylist said I can't curl my hair without making it worse!!!!!). \nTHANK YOU ULTA for for destroying my hair!!!!

There are rows and rows of all of these items, so many options in each category it's dizzying! \n\nPrices are across the spectrum so something in every price range. For example, you can buy a Conair blow dryer for $24.99 or a Dyson Blow dryer for $449.99 with dozens of options in between. Personally, I'm blown away that so many people buy the Dyson hair dryer and curling iron, which are often sold out! What do these people do for a living that they can afford this? LOL \n\nMy favorite thing about Ulta is the sample sizes which allow you to try out an item for a fair price without making a major commitment. Today I bought a travel size bottle of Dolce & Gabbana perfume for $29 rather than $120 for a regular sized bottle. I'm wearing it and I'm and loving it, so now I can commit to the full size product and price. \n\nThere are lots of fun items that make great stocking stuffers. I mean, where else can you find a colorful loofah that looks like a unicorn! \n\nThere are always specials of the day and flash sales. Today I bought an Ulta blush, liquid eyeliner and two gel eyeliners for $18. They were all on sale and then if you bought 3 you got the 4th for free. \n\nCustomer service reps were everywhere, and contrasting with other Yelpers experiences, I was getting a bit annoyed by how many times I was asked if I needed help.

She aims to please and works hard to make sure that you are happy with your results. She stays up-to-date on the latest treatments like Keratin and a variety of colors services. She is the manager of the entire hair salon and her excellent skills as a leader and as a hairstylist are very noticeable. I would give her and the salon a five star rating.

This store however lacks in customer service and stock. On all my trips, I've never once have had a positive experience with an associate. One time in particular, an associate was at the front letting customers entering the store know about a promotion where you received a free weekender bag if you purchased 35$ in perfume. After browsing, I decided to purchase perfume and when I was being rung up the cashier was totally oblivious(even though the employee announcing the promotion was not even 10 feet away). I had to ask about the bag and then she rolled her eyes, checked the price of the perfume I was buying and said \"Oh yeah, go pick one out.\" She made me feel stupid about the promotion and when I pointed out her mistake, she didn't even work hard to rectify it. But to move on to the stock issue, I've been in twice the last week to purchase a foundation. The first time an associate told me to come back the next day as they were receiving a shipment. I came back 2 days later and the shelf looked exactly the same. This is a common occurrence as they usually don't have what I'm looking for or need.

I was wrong! She changed our life! Her instructions were so detailed, thorough, and easy to implement into our lives. Our son had to be rocked and nursed to sleep. He woke up every couple of hours and the process had to be started all over again. Within just a couple of nights of using her new routine our son was sleeping 12 hours a night.

Heart breaking, I know! Our son would not sleep or nap anytime we went out of town even at my parent's that we visited every other weekend his whole life.

I made an appointment for the following month, and will be back here like clockwork to keep these brows under control!\n\nThe rest of the store is great too.  There are always good deals ($2 Ulta nail polishes, $5 off coupons, etc), and you can test everything.  So fantastic.  They have a good selection of both high end and drug store cosmetics.

Quick story...\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to stop in today after a long day out. We live right nearby and have passed this place over 100 times, but today was the day that we finally decided to get some treats.  The place itself is super small and there is very limited seating, but the owner is what makes this place worth Yelping about.\n\nThe owner could see that it was our first time there, so she gave us a quick rundown of the menu.  We decided to get some baklava and a chocolate crinkle cookie to take home. The baklava was 3 pieces for $3, but she gave us an extra piece for free because she thought we deserved to have two pieces each. It came out to $5 and the owner told us that the credit card machine wasn't working. We didn't have any cash, but she told us that it was okay and this was on her. Wait, what? Did this seriously just happen?? Nobody does this, at least not in Boston. A free piece of baklava and now everything was on the house. \n\nWe ran home (and ate some of the crinkle cookie on the way. It was amazing. So crumbly and buttery and just so good) to grab some cash and quickly went back to pay our debts (and get another cookie). \n\nNow that I finally tasted the baklava, I can say that the food is just as good as the service. It was so flaky and had the perfect amount of honey. \n\nWe're both looking forward to going back and trying some of their acma sandwiches that people rave about.

I returned on the day I told the manager and went straight to the counter as instructed. The cashier on that time did her job but I felt that she could have done better- could have apologized for having incorrect number of items inside that bag, but instead she just took the previous goodies I was returning and checked the new bag if it has complete items and thats it! If it was suggested to me that I could return it to a different location that's near me I would rather do that. Macy's offer a top notch customer service plus free delivery on any beauty purchase.

In my normal course of activity, I would not naturally end up here.  But since it was but a hop, skip and a jump from WGBH, I scooted on over for a bit of something savory after having lined my belly with ice cream, cotton candy, and chips.\n\nThe bakery is Turkish with seats for about 10.

It arrived a rather large (circumferencially) yet thin hoop filled with bright fresh vegetables (namely halved grape tomatoes and sliced bell peppers).  It was salty sweet, crisp soft tender.  It was a good portion, so I took most of it back with me.  My mom liked it too, and she generally doesn't like olives either.\n\nThe lemon tart had a good crust, but I was hoping for a more striking or intense lemon flavor - this was more creamy calm, than in your face.\n\nWe couldn't tell the two Boreks apart till we cut into them.  Per instruction, I baked them in the oven at 350 for 5-10 minutes after their overnight in the fridge.  The chicken was a tad dry - perhaps because its stay in the oven was on the longer side - while both were pretty good on the whole.

We ordered delivery from the restaurant. The person who delivered to us told us that they refunded a \"red velvet cake\" that was no longer offered on the menu. This is the very first restaurant that I have ordered from that didn't call or asked us if we wanted a substitute item, which we would have happily taken INSTEAD of no cake at all. She also told us though that everything else we ordered was there. We went inside to check the rest of the items, and was also missing a panini we ordered. We had ordered two sandwiches, a salad, a pastry, and a cake. We got one salad, sandwich, and pastry. \n\nWe reached out to the delivery service about the missing panini and they said the restaurant was closed. Fine. Next day we get a response that the restaurant disputed that we did not get our panini, and they would not refund us. \n\nI'm not in the business to fight over the invisible panini, but what I am in the business for, is service. Sultana...you could use a bit of it. Are you going to have people who claim they didn't have cheese on their sandwich, but ate it all? Sure. Those people suck, but as a business, you suck it up and you give the customer the benefit of the doubt because in this case, you are here to uphold not just the quality of your food, but your service. Some will tell you service is everything, even if you have the best food in town because without it, no one wants to deal with a sour taste in their mouth before they even try the food. \n\nI'd be happy to change my review around if you spend the effort to find out where you went wrong on the order that the panini never made it to us. For the $53 dollar charge we paid for lunch, it really made it worse that we paid $9.11 between tip,delivery fee, and tax to receive $29 worth of food. The worst thing about it is denying that you made a mistake, and choosing to not refund us for the missing sandwich.\n\nNow in regards to food quality. Overall it would have been a 3.5 stars. The salad was great, thank you for listening to all the customization my colleague asked for as you provided what she asked for. Your potato Borek was good, it was crispy, filling tasty, and big.

I had made an appointment to have my daughters hair done in a formal style for her Homecoming dance this evening. My daughter had selected a few pictures of the style prior to her appointment. We show up 10 mins early to the appointment, check in and wait. We were told that Jennifer ( who is also the salon manager) was on her lunch and would be with us shortly. She was 10 minutes late. After my daughter showed her the pictures, she started on her hair. She told us it would be about an hour. I let her know that we had to leave by 3:30. I could tell that my daughter was not happy with the way her hair was being done and Jennifer was extremely rough with her, to the point that my daughters head was being jerked back. I told my daughter that if she was not happy, she should speak up and communicate to her that it wasn't what she wanted. As my daughter started to speak up, she quickly and rudely cut her off and blurred out \" I'm not done yet!\". She rushed the rest of the job, as she was already over the hour that she told us and was being extra rough. The finished product looked absolutely AWFUL.

Consider the dilation process alone takes 20 minutes.  \n\nThe series of tests required for accurate diagnosis of one's eye is cumbersome, yet a necessary evil. However, these tests are interpreted during your examination as part of the examination.  (This is not like those chest x-rays or yearly breast exams that you go home and wait a couple of days for your results).  \n\nThe support staff is extremely professional and outstanding. I have taken notice that despite any unexpected delays, the staff never waivers. I am impressed that they are always doing their best to acknowledge my presence and their appreciation that I have selected Dedham Ophthalmic Consultants and Surgeons as my eye care choice.\n\nIn closing, although you may wait a period of time to see your physician - all I have encountered at this practice have been willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time ensuring that I understand the diagnosis and subsequent treatment they are extending to my two sons. hands down, class act, comfortable office, friendly staff, caring physicians.

I am willing to bet that everything on the menu is deeeeelicious, because after speaking with Lale, it was quite evident that now only does she take enormous pride with everything she creates, but, she so enjoys making them!\n\nBe certain to visit the Sultana's Bakery & Caf\u00e9, it is so easy to find.....Green B line.....Washington Street stop...you can order in advance and take your marvelous menu choice with you if you do not have time to eat at the caf\u00e9.......the only unfortunate situation about the caf\u00e9 is that it is very tiny.....I do not think there are 25 seats, but, believe me it would be worth the wait, or as expressed....order in advance and take the fabulous food to go.....JUST GO.....there is NO WAY you will be disappointed! \n\nSee you again soon Lale.....thank you for following your passion and being the right profession.....you are truly a gifted chef!", "date": "2020-02-02 18:50:07"}, {"review_id": "ZEplHNRmWUzH8AJiiLMssw", "user_id": "I-g9VVup2d13kODuJvybjw", "business_id": "9BSIxIkwl3qB3wKRTcM-dA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Yes I experienced a wait as other reviewers have mentioned, but I could not have been more satisfied with the exam by the technician and with my consultation with Dr. Gillies who is thorough, direct, and clear.

For starters, I received the most thorough and detailed new patient packet when I first booked to see them in 2015. It extensively covered what is required of me as a patient and what to expect. Sadly, many here have clearly failed to go through their Welcome Packet - which does forewarn you of potential wait times. It even provides you an explanation as to why this can happen.\n\nOver the past four years, there have been occasions when I have been given a courtesy call, on the day of my appointments, to alert me they are behind schedule. (I have no other doctor practice that extends this courtesy).\n\nI have actually worked in doctors' facilities in my previous lifetime. I am FULLY SENSITIVE to the FACT that many people sign on for insurance without bothering to understand what is and what is not covered. That IS NOT the responsibility of a doctor's office - believe it or not. Yes, they bill insurance companies and yes they sign on as providers of various insurance - but again, it IS NOT the responsibility of ANY physician practice to know the ins and outs of your own.\n\nI will TRY to put this in simple terms. If you are employed by Corporation A with BC/BS you may have a better deductible and lower co-pay with Corporation A, than an employee who works for Corporation B who is also covered by BC/BS. (So knowing that even with the same insurance provider - reimbursements differ.) Please explain, how you would expect any front desk receptionist to know the intricacies of not just every plan, but the actual terms of each and every contract for every corporation out there.\n\nI felt, as a former employee in the healthcare sector, and having been faced with many patients who never bothered to understand or know their insurance - this is a bone of contention for me. So, I had to rebut some of the comments here. KNOW YOUR INSURANCE.\n\nWait times at Dedham Ophthalmic Consultants are the result of the thorough eye exams followed by an informative exchange of my condition with the doctor. So, if a physician spending too much time is a problem, then the walk-in clinic might suit those complaining here better.

I was advised by Dr Jhaveri that once I paid for the consultation and the procedure (which came to over $700), all work done in relation to the procedure, within the next 3 months, would be covered by the cost I had already paid.\n\nI took my dad back in, a couple of weeks later, for a follow up. He got checked and all was good. Then I took him back in again for another follow up and, to my surprise, I was charged $140.

My issue is that I was never told about the fact that that specific exam was not covered. They assumed it'd be ok and that I would just pay for it out of pocket. And I did, of course. However, it really makes me feel like I was duped, since I was specifically told whatever else we did regarding that procedure would be covered by what I had paid. It makes me feel like they have no respect for their patients' money.

I was browsing when a sales girl asked if I was looking for something in particular, so I explained my purpose for being in the store. She told me that she was wearing a specific foundation, and asked if she could show it to me. I agreed, because it looked nice, and she led me over to the Clinique section. I told her I was not comfortable purchasing Clinique products, because I've read from multiple sources that they have some of the lowest animal testing standards in the industry. She said the company does not test on animals in the US, but once the products ship to China, that country does require animal testing so it could take place there. Knowing what I'd read, I tried to be polite and told her I would need to do more research before making a decision, and tried to walk away. She insisted on reiterating what she'd already told me, that she knows they don't test on animals in the US, and claimed she could never work for a company that tested on animals, went on and on about her love for animals, then tried for a \"hail mary\" in bragging about their offer of samples before committing to a product. I didn't just leave the section, I left the store completely. Ulta is a beauty store, not a used car lot - I'm not dealing with aggressive sales tactics, especially when the associate is being outright manipulative.

We are equally committed to consumer health and safety, and bringing to market products that comply with applicable regulations in every country in which our products are sold.\n\nWe do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law. We evaluate our finished products in clinical tests on volunteer panels.\n\nClinique Laboratories, LLC. fully supports the development and global acceptance of non-animal testing alternatives. To this end, the Company works extensively with the industry at large and the global scientific community to research and fund these alternatives.\"\n\nThat little statement, \"except when required by law\" is where the issue lies.

This is my 3rd visit with Dr. Valentini. I had no intention of ever leaving her and have full confidence in her. The office was crowded and there was 3 people in front of me. I was greeted by a woman named Nxxx, who was all business and did not even crack a smile. She asked me for my insurance card. I gave her my vision card and she said \"What's this?\" I told her it was my vision insurance. She asked me if my exams were billed through medical or vision. I answered I wasn't sure but I thought it was both while thinking, isn't this her job to know this. She proceeded to tell me that they do not take United Health Care anymore. I felt panicked. I asked why wasn't I notified of this? I made the appointment a year in advance. I never received an answer to this and my question was completely dodged! She told me my BCBS may cover the whole thing if it's billed under medical, but I was pretty sure it wasn't, which is why I have the supplemental vision insurance because they cover the $110.00 or maybe more, eye exam portion.  She told me I would need to check with my insurance company. I asked her, \"can't you look in the system and see how it was billed out previously?\" She SNAPPED at me and said \"that's what I'm DOING!\" I'm sorry I'm not a mind reader. She did a lot of staring at the computer, no communication, no eye contact! Fortunately I had the time to call. When I called BCBS they told me that only the medical portion would be covered. They also told me that I should not be calling, the office, SHE should be calling to find out what is covered, because that's THEIR job. I am in the medical field and already know this, but I wanted to hear it for myself anyway. Next I called my vision insurer. They told me that Dr. V. was still in their network. N. said, \"oh they don't update their files.\" BTW, I still have not had any eye contact from this woman. Not knowing what to believe I opted to leave, not wanting to get billed for an eye exam. Now I have taken a day off for no reason, did not get my eyes checked today, have to find a new eye Dr. in the network and have all my records transferred over. If the office had notified me like they SHOULD OF, I would of gladly changed insurance providers as my employer offers several to stay with Dr. V. An apology goes a long way. If I had be greeted like a human being and they had said, we're sorry mame, yes you should of been notified,  this review wouldn't even be going up. Dr. V. is great, I can't change insurance until Jan. 1. I would love to go back to her, but I will never forget how RUDE this person was to me and never want to be in the same room as her again. Just to add, Jxxxx that orders the eye glasses is just as unprofessional and very suspicious. Last year an elderly woman was in front of me and was complaining about the prices of the glasses. When she left he unloaded on me how all the old lady's are crabby and cheap. He told me he's been in the business for over 20 years. Clearly he is burnt out and hates his job. Also, he made my glasses wrong. I told him I wanted the smudge resistant film put on them, but he didn't order it. They also will not give you a receipt for your glasses, just a credit card total, very suspicious!  I called the office this morning because I want to talk to Dr. V. about the staff.

It was nothing like what I used to get.  The shell was also extremely dry and had an off taste to it.  \n\nFinally, the gooey butter cookie was overcooked as well.
