Compared to other Nordstrom Racks, this store has more upscale merchandise and the items are more organized (sizes are not as mixed up) than the average Rack.\n\nMy problem with the store is the changing culture within the Rack stores in general and this store in particular from what has traditionally been the service oriented Nordstrom brand. On my most recent visit to this store, I lost track of time and was late for an appointment. I had a full shopping cart of merchandise and told the register person that I was leaving my cart and I would be back right back...less than one hour.  The register person, who was obviously new and nervous, said he couldn't help me. I asked him to please contact his manager, explain the situation, and to tell the manager that I was a level four customer. With that I left for my appointment. Upon my return, my basket was not where I left it. I asked the same register person if the manager had taken possession of my shopping cart. He said he had no idea what happened to it and indicated that he had notified the staff of my situation over his wireless. I asked for the manager but she was unavailable. The assistant manager was very helpful in trying to solve my problem by trying to find my items which had been removed from my cart. Based on the short amount of time that I was gone, It is reasonable to assume that an extra effort was placed on removing my shopping cart from the floor and putting the inventory back in stock. I was fortunate enough to find the Easter clothes that I had picked out for my grandchildren and I was happy not to purchase the items that I had selected for myself. Again the assistant manager did an excellent job in trying to mitigate my problem.\n\nI did decide to wait to speak to the manager mostly out of curiosity to find out how this could happen. Natasha, the store manager, came to speak with me. She explained that she has a zero tolerance policy for holding merchandise. I asked \"What if someone went out to their car to get their wallet, would you put their merchandise back...surely there must be some flexibility?\"  Natasha stated that they do not allow merchandise to be held in anyway. I replied \"and this is how you treat a level four customer?\" (Meaning and how badly would you treat a level one customer.) Natasha firmly stated that \"they treat level one through four customers exactly the same way...they don't bend the rules for anyone.\" Natasha totally misses that her job as the manager should be to help accommodate ALL her customers when the store's rules or policies don't make sense! She is so proud that she equally helps no one???\n\nAdditionally, it's clear that this particular Nordstrom Rack has a training problem with it's register staff. They are far less knowledgeable and proficient than other Rack stores. Also, the management does not properly adjust the register manning when needed. This is evident by frequent long lines.\n\nIn conclusion...Traditionally a great store but register staff needs more training and supervision and Manager Natasha needs an attitude adjustment or a new job!", "date": "2018-03-30 14:25:20"}, {"review_id": "JqHD_kmprGlzEgPcVFTOMA", "user_id": "Vi2XU1-UoDWRXWgbKyF0zg", "business_id": "Zg-L95wu1NXK9DPH8JEFyA", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "It's a fine enough store when you have time to wade through the racks.

Shoes are just everywhere, which makes it much harder to browse and look for something. Every time I at at a Nordstrom Rack that does this, I always begin to look and browse in my shoe size but then quickly give up after a few minutes because of how messy the shelves are. There may be some great finds in this section but I am just not willing to put in the time and effort.\n\nOverall, this visit was a little disappointing.

I find it tedious and boring and I can never pick the right things.  Personal shopper to the rescue. I paid an extra fee for a Nordstrom shopper to come to my home and clear out my closet and then set me up with a basics wardrobe.   The visit was good although upon reflection I should have skipped it and just booked directly through Nordstrom for free as 99.9% of the clothes recommended we're from Nordstrom anyway.    Along with the fee was an initial home visit (complete) and also a follow up to show me how to wear the items / this follow up never happened.  \n\nNow I'm aware that this service is different from the Nordstrom offering but my 2 star review stands for both.   I'll say I loved the clothes I came home with and I loved how the fitting room was ready to go when I arrived. \n\nMy issue is and was a complete lack of follow up.  There were items that were supposed to be following in the mail that were to match with other pieces I already bought.  It took me a long time and a few texts to realize some of this items were not available.   I also wanted a few other pieces / in particular a certain pair of louboutins and was just told to hold off until the fall....even though I wanted them right away if they were available.  I was owed a refund on some sale items --  that took a long time to get and required me to ask for it which to be honest kind of feels gross (who wants to call and ask repeatedly when your discount is going to be refunded but it was a few thousand....).  No one has ever followed up for anything Fall related. I've since called Holts to book an appointment.  I don't know, when you spend xx,xxx in one shop I'd expect follow you to be better but to be honest even if you only spend $100 a place with good customer service would have that dialed in.    I just got the sense that unless you are a high roller you aren't getting great customer service and you'll have to do a lot of the follow up yourself.   \n\nIt's unfortunate because this store it's awesome.

My husband and I always make sure to stop by when we are in Vancouver. I unfortunately had one of my worst customer service experiences there in March when I visited the on Friday, March 17th with a cosmetic consultant and it was far from my typical Nordstrom's experience. I went to the Charlotte Tilbury counter and asked about the product line. The associate began speaking to me and gave me some information about the company as I have been it in the UK, and this was the first time I have seen it in Canada. During our conversation, another customer approached us, and in the middle of our conversation (while we were still talking) , and began asking the associate some questions. The associate  then stopped our conversation, and without a word to me, walked around behind me, and began to show the customer who interrupted us, the products she was interested in. All I can say was I was shocked and appalled. I just kept thinking \"did she just walk away from me in the middle of our conversation without even saying a word to me?\" I realize customer service is not an easy profession and bad service does happen; however, in all my years of experiencing bad customer service, I have never had a sales associate walk away from me to help a customer who interrupted our conversation, without even saying a word to me. Excusing the rudeness of the situation, at least a \"I'll be right back\" to me may have been in order. All I can say is WOW, that was really bad  customer service, something that I did not expect from a store like Nordstrom's. I emailed the store manager about my experience in March but so far, no word from him about my store experience...", "date": "2016-06-01 18:35:20"}, {"review_id": "a4H5NKmS8_Co8ziczEnirA", "user_id": "RsHU3i0x_GeeTYO1AO8Q6g", "business_id": "NvStvbwW3bI3rVrBkCC_4w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I should probably preface this review by saying that I'm an avid Nordstrom fan and have been for close to 20 years, that I've visited many US Nordstrom stores prior to the opening of the Vancouver store  and that I've been to the Vancouver Nordstrom a few times since it opened in September. For those of you who have been to a Nordstrom store, you know what the experience is like from a customer service perspective. As a result, the expectations for this store were already quite high. I can honestly tell you that this store has met and exceeded my expectations. I will explain how:\n\n(a) I've been to the men's shoe department on several occasions. Despite being very busy, I was approached in a reasonable amount of time, every single time. In one instance, the sales person was able to accommodate a hold request I had and they even priced matched a shoe I purchased a week prior where the lower price was advertised on the Nordstrom.com web site! I later found out that the store doesn't price match with the Nordstrom.com site but, because that's what was communicated to me, they went ahead and did it. The department manager was amazing to deal with, let alone her staff. I've already purchased 2 pairs (and counting...). All I can say is wow!\n\n(b) A similar experience can be said of the men's The Rail department. I was visiting LA's The Grove Nordstrom location in early September and wanted a pair of Paige jeans but didn't purchase them because I knew that the Vancouver store was opening a week from then.  Unfortunately, our Vancouver store doesn't carry that line for men (hopefully soon). However, the sales person that assisted me looked into it and found out that they could bring in the style/size of jeans I wanted from the Bellevue, WA location and that they could either be shipped to me for free or I could pick them up at the store. They will also charge the CAD price as well! This is huge, given that our exchange rate versus the US dollar is not great right now. Basically, anything you see in the store where they don't have your size, they can leverage inventory from another Canadian or US store and either ship to you or you can pick up downtown. \n\n(c) The service I have experienced in the Men's department as a whole has been nothing short of amazing. In EVERY situation where I have been approached by a sales person, what comes across is genuinely making me feel right at home and then striking a conversation with  me rather than them breathing down my neck with the hope that I'll buy something. The best way I can describe it is that there appears to be a genuine interest in relationship building with the customer and that's something I don't see often in Vancouver.\n\n(d) I did manage to have dinner at Bistro Verde. Great service, great atmosphere and best of all, great food! I did make a reservation (via Open Table) as I knew they were quite busy and that didn't pose a problem. My guest and I were even given a free appetizer because, in the restaurant's opinion, the food wait was unacceptable. I can't say that's happened to me in a restaurant, ever.\n\n(e) I also checked out Nordstrom's Ebar. Again like the restaurant, great service, great food and great coffee (look out Starbucks)!\n\n(f) For those of you who may want to criticize Nordstrom on price, let me tell you this. It is MUCH less to buy in Canada that in the US. I've checked MANY items in the store that I subsequently checked to see if they had in the US. Each time, the price in the US was 10-15% less. In some cases the CAD price was the USD price! This is way better than purchasing in USD and paying an exchange rate that inflates the price by 35%.\n\nTo summarize, this store really does stand out on so many levels and is setting the bar very high.

So I like the prices (for the quality merchandise) at the Rack. But today's shopping experience has prompted me to write a glowing review. It was the service I received that drove me to my keyboard.\n\nI was assisted by two guys in the Men's Department - one very young and one very old - and both went above and beyond in the service department. The young guy saw me perusing suits and overheard our conversation as to what size I wear. I buy nice clothes so infrequently that I just don't remember those sorts of things. This friendly young guy whipped out his tape measure and wrapped me up in it and in no time told me I'm a 44S. Then he pulled a 44S suit off the rack and, lo and behold, it fit almost like it was made for me. I put the suit decision on the burner to simmer while I went and looked at shirts. What size? You guessed it - I don't remember. The older Rack guy whipped out his tape and informed me of the verdict (16 1/2, 33-34).\n\nPutting off a decision, I went on to shop at other downtown stores (stores where one might expect the sort of service I'm talking about here - I didn't see it) before returning to the Rack. I grabbed that first suit and was assisted by the old guy in determining what alterations were needed. With the marked and pinned suit in hand, I returned to the search for a shirt and tie. The young guy then stepped in and provided just the sort of feedback needed. He was running all over the store and picking up various shirt/tie combinations for my perusal. I actually left without a tie, as the Rack just didn't have the exactly right one for the suit/shirt combination. But I only knew this (fashion ignoramus that I freely admit I am) due to the help of this young guy.\n\nAre you served? The answer clearly was YES.

Often a nice blouse that I finally find in my (rather popular) size is still hanging there because either (a) it has been torn or spotted somehow, or (b) it just doesn't fit right on any body type. So look carefully when purchasing here and do try it on--even if it means waiting in line. \n\nThe suitcases, though also better quality, cost the same as at a proper luggage place, and are not a reason to go here, and this is also the case for handbags or purses.\n\nMy daughter looks at the jewelry (apparently nice and cheap earrings) and workout pieces, but she prefers to hit sport clothing stores for a better selection. \n\nGood luck and enjoy your search!", "date": "2015-10-26 18:17:18"}, {"review_id": "WiwUvCCUuGaZD19aRmpbrQ", "user_id": "OzT_8IW38hCIQEuz-Fyexg", "business_id": "Zg-L95wu1NXK9DPH8JEFyA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great place to find great stuff at discounted prices.

I enjoy shopping in Nordstroms in Seattle and am extremely disappointed with what the vancouver store has to offer.\nTo begin ... while in the scarf department (and I did buy one), the woman/clerk was so annoying, I had to politely ask her to leave me alone.  What a mood breaker.  There is service, then there are pains in the neck.  There was little inventory in scarves in that department, so trust me, I can look for myself.  But I did buy a nice one, and the price point of 38.00, was good .... just not the high pressured sales lady.\nThen off to jewellery where I fondly remember the US Nordstroms always has really cool \"costume\" jewellery to choose from.  Not really inexpensive, but not David Yurman, who I see is missing.  This tall woman, came up to me rather abruptely and said \"what is your name?\", she scared the bejeezus out of me.  Then I realized she was an employee.  Back off sister, and at least let me look first before you try to upsell.  I quickly left, notices some IPhone cases on a random rack, I need two, but none are 5's only 6's ... are you kidding me???  Even the salesperson said she has a 5S.\nOK, now I'm cranky.  But determined to make this store work.  I head to ladies wear second floor.  Well that was a deal buster.  Excuse me Mr. Nordstrom's, I am 60 and a bit, but have  lots of disposable income and can fit regular bottoms, but need a boost to cover the top.  Not only don't you carry plus size (shame on you), but I could not find an XL in ANY top on your second floor.  Ya see, sometimes we \"mature\" ladies can wear an xl, but depending on cut, could use a ox, or 1x. \nThen off to the pj department, while trying to buy a cute pair of socks for my daughter, a relative of the barracuda in scarves drove me crazy. NO, I don't need a cardigan to match my socks.  Really??\nDon't get me started about the shoe department ... and the trashy gym clothes at the \"rotunda\" at the main entrance of a grand department store.  I opened the old Eaton's store in this location, and there was much more class, and consumer friendly product.  BTW, I was also in charge of sales training, no comission aggression allowed.\n\nSo mr. nordstrom's, your store is not for me.  I did sign up for the customer reward card, but will cancel it when I've finished this email.

One stop shop for shoes, shirts, jeans, casual or business attire, athletic wear, fragrance, jewelry, you name it.\nThe downside is they dont always have certian sizes or styles in specific brands, their markdowns aren't always that great, and variety of styles and colors aren't as great as the regular Nordy's stores, but I guess thats why it's cheaper here.\nThe staff here are friendly, I can usually get assistance quickly and have them try to track down a few things for me without losing their attention to a shiny object.\nI'm an overall fan!", "date": "2014-03-20 01:35:33"}, {"review_id": "3b1wpGkAy-EEEoKeyk6EIQ", "user_id": "6jL1FcMl-EgTqw_XBk7P4Q", "business_id": "NvStvbwW3bI3rVrBkCC_4w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "Great store.

We are very loyal to this store, and we shop there (and at the Bellevue Square location) frequently. So we were very excited to check out this Vancouver site (especially since we plan on moving to this city in the coming year).\n\nThis store is smack dab in the heart of Vancouver's downtown area, on Robson, and we liked how it opened up earlier than advertised (holiday hours, I guess, as we were there the week before Xmas). Very accommodating! We were greeted warmly at the door but as I wandered the store to explore, I wasn't acknowledged or greeted in any of the store departments (cosmetics, jewelry, shoes, women's clothing on the 2nd floor...). Usually this lack of greeting might irk me somewhat but it didn't the day I visited here, as I was on vaca and hadn't slept well the night prior and looked horrid. I really wanted to browse in anonymity, so I was glad I was able to do just that on this particular day.\n\nThis store is much smaller than the downtown Seattle store but it has the same upscale brands and the in-house Halogen line (which I personally love and find more reasonably priced). It has the same glam feel and ambiance which I find makes shopping a pleasurable experience. I realize this sounds bizarre, but I even love the women's bathroom which is large and luxe and has a roomy lounge attached, so it's more of a suite than your run-of-the-mill bathroom. Bonus that this store is attached to the Pacific Center mall, so if the weather is inclement, one needn't venture outside to continue shopping. \n\nSure, prices are high here - perhaps even higher than at the Seattle store, - but the quality is top-notch, the shopping experience is unparalleled, and their customer service (especially regarding personal shoppers' assistance and their return policies) are phenomenal.

The selection and prices on these items are consistently pretty great - I'm now at the point where I'll almost never pay full-price for anything Stila, when I know I'll just be able to get it dirt-cheap later at the Rack. However, I think I would feel better about buying clothes there if it weren't for the fact that many of them are obviously seconds or flawed in some way. Case in point, I bought two winter coats at the Rack a couple of months ago. One of them was missing a button, which I had fixed by the in-house tailor, and developed HUGE holes in the pockets within a week of being purchased. The other one has shed its own buttons so frequently and consistently, even after several trips to the tailor to have the ones I managed to find reattached and tightened, that I've had to completely give up on wearing it - I lost two buttons each of the last two times I wore it out (and no, it was not too tight or anything like that). Sure, I got it at a discount, but I still spent $70 for a coat I ended up getting less than a month's worth of wear out of. Would this have happened if I'd just bought the coat full-price at Nordstrom? I have to wonder. Both pairs of the Hue \"sweater tights\" I bought there this year developed holes in the toes within the first two wearings. Is this typical?

She asked me 10 questions about how I feel about  the jeans (is it a torture, does it feel good, makes you sexy, too plain, too tight, does it give you a muffin top, does it feel too tight or alright) well, jeans are an investment piece of clothing. They make or break you. I was happy I was introduced to her. I stick with the basic dark blue jeans straight leg --  good for office and flattering for a night out. In addition, she also offered me 'while you wait' complimentary alteration. Having an in house seamstress is a plus especially if it's free. I end up buying 2 pairs of jeans.

We love our Nordstrom Racks.\n\nThis one is two-stories, with clothing and make-up on the lower street level and primarily shoes on the upper level. I primarily stayed on the main level and boy, did I find some great finds! I found some Calvin bralettes for $11 each (I bought three but, upon arriving home, my youngest daughter saw them and snagged them for herself. Woe is me!), and some gorgeous summer swingy tops on sale in the clearance racks for, again, $11 each. What a great deal!\n\nI tried to pay at the \"express check-out\" kiosks by the escalator (they only take credit cards, and all sales final if you chec-out here, which was fie with me), but the kiosks weren't staffed and, after waiting there for five minutes, nobody came to work these kiosks. So I waited in a long line by the cash to pay. They were very organized and quick, as the line moved quickly.

As with virtually all businesses, highs tend to come crashing back down to reality - something that can be more indicative of a repeatable experience.\n\nWhile you can certainly feel the Nordstrom presence, it's very much a little brother/sister of the US locations I've been to. It feels younger, looks more lively.\n\nOutside of shopping with the other half I really only venture into the men's clothing/shoes and fragrance sections but I was happy to see many brands found in the US stores carried over here. As with economies of scale it's understandable to realize that most items cannot be priced at US levels so it's up to you to decide whether you want to support the local industry (as it is within striking range in terms of $$$, based on the items I've bought) or to do one-stop shopping here instead.\n\nWhere Nordstrom has distinguished itself is in their well known excellent customer service found at every store I've been to in the US thus far. Unfortunately, nary a flicker of that eminence re-emerge here. One shouldn't have to, with shoe in hand survey the department and walk around to find a willing staff to help, especially after tracking one down busily gazing into the distance instead. Perhaps the $475 walnut coloured Allen Edmonds wingtip I brought over with me wasn't interesting enough to carry themselves over.\n\nUnfazed, I head over to fragrance, slowly going through my preferred brands. I make my way to the Diptyque counter occupied by two staff as I was interested in finding out if they carried a scent I didn't see at initial glance. I stand there momentarily as the two staff members chat. I'll let them finish. Waiting... Patiently... Hello? Wow, they're still talking. FINALLY. The idiotic waxing comes to an end, and I get a curt and forced \"hi!\". You didn't even bother to ask me if I needed help? No, I just wanted to watch you, two people I've never met before, talk!\n\nMost of the other departments were much of the same, but the stories aren't as juicy to recall.\n\nWhile it's great to see other brands and better selection of available brands here, it seems to offer much of the same mediocre customer experience that is found in our dear city far too frequently. I could've gone to The Bay across the mall and gotten the same virtually non-existent service.\n\nThis leads me to surmise whether this is another \"I work at a name brand store so I'm better than you\" pretentious Vancouver thing. Nordstrom is better than that. I can't possibly believe I'm a fusspot either, I prefer to be left alone when shopping actually!\n\nCanadian pricing and invisible service.

I'm an avid shopper and I tend to do all my shopping at Nordstrom in Bellevue, WA. I was so excited that Nordstrom opened up in Vancouver and expected the same great customer service -- boy was I wrong. I was at the La Mer counter, seriously interested in picking up some products. La Mer is super pricey, so I expected to get a little more information about products I was considering. There was a female worker there, Asian (not that it matters), and she seemed so unenthusiastic about having me asking her questions. I literally felt so intrusive and felt like I was imposing. Her tone was lackluster and she looked annoyed at the fact that I was even wasting her time. There were 0 other customers at the La Mer section. Excuse me, but you are here to serve the customer. I asked her a question, she did not show me any items or give me any recommendations, and I had to myself go look at each item to figure out what the heck I was supposed to buy. She was trying to get me to buy whatever I could and scurry, but I asked her to try a cleanser on my hand and at this point one of her friends happens to come in. Those types that you know are wealthy from the way they dress and carry themselves. They began to have a conversation in their native language while I was talking to the associate. It actually went like this: \"ok so what are the benefits of this cleanser as opposed to that one?\" and she would look away and continue to talk to her friend. She did not answer me. Her friend then grabbed a seat on those makeup demonstration chairs, and they continued talking. The Nordstrom associate was clearly super interested in her own conversation as opposed to helping a customer figure out what to buy. It was ridiculous. I felt like trash. I don't know what was worse; the fact that maybe she thought I was poor and didn't want to help me or the fact that she shunned me to talk to her friend. It was completely disrespectful and inappropriate. I have never felt so disrespected or made to feel so low at a store. A STORE I AM A FREQUENT CUSTOMER OF! Nordstrom you need to fix this, big time. I have actually on many occasions avoided shopping in your beauty section because of this. I have noticed on quite a few more occasions that a lot of your employees tend to favor richer and wealthier clients as opposed to those who maybe don't try to project their wealth so openly. I'm not sure if this is what you preach or if it seems to be the consensus of all your employees. ALL CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESPECT.

Seriously! I visit here with my 7-year-old granddaughter who adores Nordstrom's Tucker and Tate clothing brand. FINALLY we found clothing that is soft, roomy and fun to wear. T-shirts with a flare fit instead of clinging. Cute styles in comfy, casual clothes. \n\nWhen this Nordstrom didn't have an item in the right size, the clerk immediately phoned the Calgary store to check on availability. The item was found and posted to me, no charge for delivery. We are talking about a low-cost children's iitem here. \n\nWe are always welcomed by staff, and last time we shopped there we were told \"Lovely to see you again! Welcome back!\" We never have to search for a customer service person as they are plentiful. Helpful, NEVER pushy. They show us to the fitting room, help if we need help, and never interfere or try to sell, just assist where needed. And always with a smile. \n\nGranddaughter used to shop at H&M and Old Navy. No more. And for people who expect Nordstrom's to be expensive, recent purchases of leggings/pants on sale at Nordstrom were cheaper than similar (but far inferior in quality) leggings at H&M. Plus, try finding an employee to help you at H&M! Good luck! Plus, Nordstrom doesn't blast your eardrums with loud obnoxious music. (It's not a rave bar, H&M, it's a shop!) Plus, compare the tedious, endless lineups at H&M cash with the non-existent lineups at Nordstrom.

Like your name implies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rack_(torture)), you are the medieval torture device of modern retail, but like the masochistic consumer I am, I keep coming back for more. \n\nYou torture me with dreams and aspirations of getting name brand merchandise at deep, deep discounts. I'm not talking about standard brands, I am talking about the high-end designer gear that is sold at your evil stepmother store - Nordstrom's. I want a pair of 7's, but I am not willing to pay $200 for jeans. Maybe a Robert Graham shirt for less than $300? \n\nNo, no... I am not fixated on names. I have an odd size, and off-the-rack clothes look like ASS on me. Most designer gear does too. Some styles, some designs, they do the trick... but unfortunately, my wallet can't keep up. The clothes that fit my shape the best tend to be way too expensive for what they are. No plain white shirt should cost $400. \n\nSo I head down to Nordy's Rack, where I get to go through a roller-coaster of emotions in one visit.  From soaring peaks (\"OMG they DO have that shirt I had my eyes on\") to depressing troughs (\"Good baby Jesus, even after 75% off clearance this shirt is still $60 and it's 2-sizes too small!!!!\"), I get to experience a whirlwind journey in the span of only a few hours. \n\nSmall, cramped, usually steeped in utter chaos, shopping at The 'Rack is only one step above doing battle with the regulars at the Goodwill bin store. People shopping in this store are generally rude, aggressive, and cutthroat. If you see something you want, you better grab it, fast. If you have something you want and someone is eying it, you better have a firm grip. \n\nI would have  to say that about 50% of the time I walk into the Rack, I walk out with at least one item. Sometimes I spend way too much, and sometimes I search for hours and am unable to find anything I want. This location offers a pretty good selection for this Portland market, but it's nowhere near the Seattle store. I would be a broke, well-dressed man if I lived within striking distance of the downtown Seattle Nordstrom Rack.  The men's section at that store is probably twice the size, with way more top-end content. But hey, that's Seattle, and this is sleepy 'lil PTown. So go figure. \n\nAmazing clothes, amazingly cheap prices, and an unpretentious (and downright contentious) shopping experience.

First, this location was alive and bustling when I arrived in the late afternoon to buy some designer men's clothing and accessories. The first floor seemed particularly appealing and cosmopolitan. It was high energy and very engaging. It was also a bit confusing  because there was not a sign anywhere that I could spot in the places you might expect one, like near the escalator. But, as expected, there was a nearby service desk where an associate happily pointed me to the third floor.\n\nMen's suits and jackets were a disappointment because they were so staid and boring. Cuts, fabrics, and styles were simply blah. Still, there was so much on the rest of the floor, that it would be hard to leave empty handed. Designer sections had interesting items and there were numerous racks of anniversary sale items to look over. I approached table after rack after display and noticed how the only thing missing on the floor was a sales associate actually helping anyone. There were a few talking with friends. There were two others talking on cell phones. More were arranging items to keep the sales racks looking fresh and interesting. \n\nI had my eye on a jacket on a mannequin. I liked another on a rack. The latter was $850 Canadian. The former was unmarked and I could not find another anywhere in the department, but I suspected it would be even more. I was prepared to buy it if it looked good on me an fit well. If it didn't work out, a good sales person would have me in something else that was interesting in no time. \n\nBut I left empty handed because there were no associates interested in my custom. At one point a friendly looking man commented on what I was holding up in a mirror; I mistook him for a sales associate because he took the cue that actual workers there did not.  I took the escalator back down to one and stopped at the service desk to tell them I was disappointed by the lack of service in the men's department. I was offered the manager's business card and I have noticed his name responding to many reviews here.  But what good are his cards or comments? Train and incentivize your staff for relating to people who want to buy things from your store. Have people paid to shop your store and give you feedback on their experiences.

It's ironic how HR prides itself as a Canadian company but clearly doesn't cater to the Canadian shoppers who share Canadian values. I'm selling out and going with the US based retailer.

During the opening day I bought a bag from him, he knows I'm picky because I told him and he would go back and forth getting the best stock for me without any hesitation and still with a huge smile. I've been buying from the same person ever since because he knows how to treat customers very well, he never pressures me into buy something he will only tell you the truth about what you need and what you want. So the result is he has earned a customer for life, my sister and I have been shopping with him and I don't Mind driving 3 hours to pick up my stuff because he's such a good sales person and lives up to Nordstrom's motto when it comes to excellent and above and beyond customer service skills. I hope the general manager Chris Wanlass reads this because he used to be the GM of Bellevue and all I can say is he does a really good job in training the sales people in Nordstrom, my husband and I also met Tiffany who is the assistant store manager in designer hand bags and she is very warm and accommodating, all I can say is Nordstrom is one of a kind, they know how to give the best customer service out there, they know how to treat people accordingly and respect each individual, everybody is equally treated right at Nordstrom, that's why we only shop here and shifted all purchases to Nordstrom if only they had a grocery too that would be so convenient ;) Nordstrom is one of a kind, I have no words to describe how happy we are shopping here.

Being a transplant from Seattle to Vancouver, it's been difficult. Let's face it customer service and variety is lacking. Boutiques aren't very helpful or friendly, Holts is a joke (customer service what?) and the Bay is as about as bad as it gets. So again, I was super happy when I heard Nordstrom was coming. I was also a little nervous, because Target came too and we all know how that panned out. \nI finally made it in yesterday (would have been there sooner, but I have an 8 month old and it's hard to get anything done) anyway, we showed up to a beautiful store that was well stocked. We first went to the kids shoe department where 3 employees were super friendly playing with my daughter and even gave her a balloon. We wanted a particular pair of shoes but they were out of her size. The sales associate said that she could check other stores and have them shipped to my house for FREE. She found them and had them shipped to me apparently they were coming from Seattle, well guess what... That was yesterday and TODAY they have arrived at my house, just 1 day later:)\nI'm happy to say this is the same Nordstrom I'm use to in the states, same great customer service, and same great selection.

You do NOT get the doting sales people and luxurious dressing rooms, but you DO get incredible prices! \n\nFor example... I got several nice blouse-type shirts for just under $10, and a nice skirt for only $15. EVERYTHING I bought was on serious markdown. Our 12 pieces of clothing cost only about $300 (two skirts, a blazer, dress pants, another work jacket, a cashmere sweater, another sweater, BCBG blouse, a few tops, etc.). It was truly incredible! \n\nThere is a section for petites, a section for juniors, women, men, children, lingerie, activewear, shoes, and makeup/accessories. There's also a clearance section (yes, clearance from the already marked down Rack prices!). Very cool! Once I found this section I tried to work from there. My blazer was originally $200 and was marked down to $15 once it was in clearance. It's super dressy pin-stripe, but good to keep on hand.\n\nDressing rooms have a limit of 15 items at a time, but they will hold your extras while you try them on, without even giving you attitude for bringing in a whole cart-full of clothes to try. :)\n\nAlso, they give you points on your regular Nordstrom card, so you can rack up the points while getting more bang for your buck!\n\nSo go here if you are looking to browse, or if you need a new wardrobe.

My favorite section of the store is the shoe department. Where else can you get a pair of pristine Barbara Bui heels for $100?! Oh, and did I mention all the very very well priced sneakers? There's even a nice designer section, just in case you don't want to browse all the aisles for the next addition to your Stuart Weitzman collection.\n\nThe rest of the store is great as well. Always stocked with lots of denim, athletic gear, trusted brands, and new trendy stuff as well. One thing I especially like about Nordstrom Rack is that it has a very respectable Men's department, so don't forget to bring the man or men in your life!

It's at the front of the store, with multiple different check out stations in different departments.

My husband and I are from Rhode Island.  We were in Massachusetts for a quite stressful medical procedure.  To cheer me up, my husband decided to take me to the mall.  We stopped in the Nordstroms at the Dior cosmetics counter.  My husband said I could pick whatever I wanted.  I was specifically looking for a lip plumper I had years before.  A funny and personable saleswomen came to us immediately.  She made us laugh, put as at ease, and promptly pointed out what I was looking for. She saw me eyeing a similar product in the Dior line, as well as some nail polish.  She offered her honest opinion on both products, as well as her personal experience with them (VERY helpful!).  She let me try the polish and gave me enough time to decide if I wanted it or not.  All this time while helping me ...she was also talking to and engaging my poor bored husband.  When she found out he served in the military, she gave him much praise and thanked him for his service.  At check out time I decided on the lip gloss. My husband got out his credit card and said \"are you sure you don't want anything else?\" ....again, trying to cheer me up :)  I said I would take the nail polish too :)  The saleswoman of course was witnessing all this...at the end she said wait here I want to get you some free-gifts.  She came back with several items (6 total) from the Dior line AND a tester of the other lip gloss I was eyeing!!!  She handed it to me and looked at my husband and thanked him for his service.  What a great woman!  She totally made my day...AND my husband's. She made a very positive impact at a time we both needed it... we appreciate that so much!

Having bought suits exclusively from Nordstrom for the last 15 years, we'll never go back.  Bought yet another suit a few months ago and having to bicker with their nasty antiquated tailors (not exclusive to this location), we were on the fence about even going to pick up the suits.\n\nStopped by today finally to pick up a brand new suit we bought and had tailored - meh as always, no such thing as listening to customer on the break of the pants, desire for more of tailored / slim fit, and taking it in where requested.  Seems their tailors are stuck in the mode of the more classic (nothing wrong with it, not my style) pleated billowy pants with cuffs, and have repeatedly fought any such request.  \n\nOn top of that, we had brought in another suit we purchased at another Nordstrom to be tailored again.  Now this was the second time we went in, as we were snarkily told it had to be dry cleaned first before they could tailor it.  After doing that and having it marked up/fitted, we arrived today to find the second suit hadn't even been tailored and still had the chalk lines on it.   We were told it had been fitted, when it hadn't been.  To be fair they refunded the tailoring fee and were professional (but not very apologetic).  We were relieved honestly, since I'll have to take both suits to a real tailor to have them both redone anyway.   We left knowing we'll never return.\n\nI know Nordstrom believes they know what is good for you but listen to your customer.

I almost didn't though because they invited me to their opening night event in Natick and wanted me to pay $150 to attend. I am not paying to shop! The invite was quite fancy, but still I'm not paying to shop. Maybe the event was really cool, but I skipped that and opted to check out when it was free. \n\nHandbag Dept: I loved it. I bought a beautiful and quite expensive Car Shoe Handbag (a Prada brand). The staff was really nice and helpful during my purchase. They had Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Furla and much more. I was pleased with the selection.\n\nMens Dept was pretty good as well. I got my bf a fall wool jacket. \n\nWomen's clothes was interesting. It seems they are trying to test out the market? Tory Burch only had 1 rack that had like 4 different dresses and that was it. BCBG and Theory only had 1 rack each as well. BCBG I can understand since they have a store in the same mall, but Theory and Eli Tahari need a whole section. The jeans selection seemed pretty decent, but I didn't find anything I wanted. St John had a huge section. Is that the the brand the core audience buys? I'm not sure maybe, but I'd like less of that and more theory. \n\nAccessories Dept was decent. I bought some nice long black leather gloves and the staff was once again helpful. \n\nMakeup Dept - needs some help - well maybe not. I may not be fair in my review of this. MAC was great. The woman in MAC was extremely helpful. Got what I wanted, recommended a few things and rang me in quickly. But over at Mario Badescu there wasn't anyone (perhaps it was because it was 7 pm on a weekday?). A woman came over from another makeup brand, but she didn't' know anything about the line and couldn't really help me. She tried, but it would have been nice to have someone that was familiar with the line working there. \n\nRestaurant - perfect for a quick bite to eat while I was shopping after work. I have shopped at Nordstrom's now about 5 times and each time tried the restaurant salads and sandwiches have all been decent. The one thing I didn't like - waiting in line and ordering at a counter, but then sitting to get my food delivered by a server and having to tip them. Either have me order and wait to pick it up and sit down, or just have normal table service. I am a good tipper, but don't make me wait in line to order for 15 minutes - then sit and still have a server I have to tip that only brought over a drink and my meal.\n\nAnd then to the Shoe Dept. This dept confused me. I love high end designer shoes. They had Manolo's and Prada which made me very happy. But there was only like 1 or 2 tables for designer shoes and about 50 for shoes like Jessica Simpson brand. UMM if I just paid $1000 for a purse (and the lowest price point on purses is roughly $400) why would I buy $80 shoes? I want to see more high end shoes. If I were someone that likes to buy $80 shoes, I also probably want to buy $80 handbags? No? Why would I buy a $1500 Burberry bag, then $80 Jessica Simpson shoes? It just didn't really fit for me. I think they should totally still sell all kinds of brands of shoes, I just want to see a larger premium designer shoe section.", "date": "2008-01-03 21:55:17"}, {"review_id": "75f3Vj01xAM6-3Hp-3hdGg", "user_id": "q31f3uFJsFTNFFolAQkWCQ", "business_id": "GPRK8YsMzly8f5P0RunMaw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 4, "cool": 1, "text": "5 stars and service to boot \n\ni needed, no scratch that, wanted to get my mother a bday present, what a good son i am! shes on a headband fashion thing, so lets indulge her like the good boy i am. \n\nupon entering the store i felt pretty comfortable, which to tell the truth, was pretty surprising considering i went from the gym to the collection (pinkie up.) i though i would attract evil snootie eyes from the fancypantes, but maybe mer was in her easter best for pictures upstairs so they gave me the benefit of doubt. \n\nwe perused for a few minutes in the accessories department when were approached by, and i know this isnt close to being right, sorry miss, algina, well her name was close to that (sorry miss, you were very helpful though!) and since she didnt have a name-tag, i tried my best. well anyway, she tried a few times to locate us the products in the style we sought. i give her credit for being persistence, but not overbearing, i think you know what i mean especially when you go to somewhere like this when you arent dressed to the nines. \n\nwell anyway, i found two yentarific headbands which i think mom will like and my new salesfriend wrapped them up real nice with a bow and box and fancy. i bet my mom is going to re-gift the box with some junk in it to her friends, she does that sort of thing. \n\ngood experience, fairish price, but you knew that for the name of the store. happy to see service met that price tag.", "date": "2010-03-22 13:37:22"}, {"review_id": "ZdgU-DPP7qMlLolrfs29YQ", "user_id": "Ppndp10ubGlrcQ4wji7Tww", "business_id": "GPRK8YsMzly8f5P0RunMaw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Yesterday I went to Nordstrom looking for shoes for an upcoming event.

Of all the places I've ever purchased suits from high end (e.g. Paul Stuart) to more affordable (e.g. Syms), this Nordstroms has the absolute worst tailors; their sales \"talent\" is so obnoxious, they make the Yankee fans look aristocratic.  Tailoring a suit takes talent, but butchering a suit and trying to tell you its fine - well that takes Nordstrom.  A well tailored suit jacket should lie flat across the shoulder.  Somehow, after the firs tailoring, there was a substantial dipping in the fabric on one shoulder.  The pants were left so long, I looked like a child in his father's suit.  Additional work that needed to be done like adjusting the jacket buttons was left undone.  After trying on the remaining pants, one pair was done correctly.  Yes, they were apologetic, and promised to fix the suit and pants.  Had it ended there, I would not be writing this review.  But when I went back, they managed to make the first shoulder worse AND ruin the second shoulder.  It gets better.  They tried the gang up technique, two sales people, two tailors telling me it looked fine.  I was starting to wear down when my wife came in and unprompted said - \"What did they do to that suit?\".  I pulled and tugged, but still it looked awful.  At 6'2\", I thought maybe they tailor couldn't see the top of my shoulders. So I asked her to step up by the mirrors to have a close look.  She finally saw the problem.  Again, promises to fix it.

At first you may not get what the fuss is all about, but after shopping there a few times, believe me, you will get it.  \n\nHere are few things that set Nordstrom apart from other stores:\n\n1.)  The customer service is some of the best out there.  The sales associates are knowledgeable, friendly, and make you feel like you are important to them, no matter how small your purchase.  I don't know where they find these people, but I've never had a bad experience with a Nordstrom SA.\n\n2.) The return policy is the most flexible return policy on this planet.   No time limits on returns and no questions asked.   I once returned a pair of shoes that I had worn several times.  It became apparent to me after wearing the shoes that they weren't comfortable and they were never going to become \"broken in\".  Brought them back and my account was credited, no questions asked.   Good policy on their part because I spent a lot of money that day in their store.\n\n3.)  They have amazing sales, the best of which is their annual anniversary sale in July.  This is not your typical end of season clearance type of sale.  They bring in all new merchandise and offer the new styles at sale prices.  I look forward to this sale all year.  \n\n4.)  If they don't have something in your size, they will find it for you at another store and ship it to you for free, as long as the item is over $25.   \n\n5.)  They will do price matching.   Yep, you heard me right.  A high end department store that does price matching.  This is awesome because I often find items online for a lower price, but I would much prefer to buy from Nordstrom where I can get treated like a VIP, and have the comfort of knowing that if something doesn't work out I can return it very easily.\n\nSo give it a try and before long you too will be wondering why you ever shopped anywhere else.", "date": "2009-11-09 02:46:00"}, {"review_id": "rjgPNL-2-6LWs4slDLwrKw", "user_id": "Z-DKi7-fDEDAC7REdA3svQ", "business_id": "GPRK8YsMzly8f5P0RunMaw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Love it here!

I had to hunt down a sales associate to start me a fitting room (she continually walked by me and approached other clients). She didn't check on my once. When I was done trying everything on, I went to the register. The original sales person was ringing another customer at the time so someone else began to ring me up. While I was in mid sentence asking her a question about a specific bra, another client came over and rudely interrupted telling the sales associate she needed something and couldn't find it.

She just walked away and left me standing there for another 5 minutes while she was helping this rude client find God knows what. \n\nWhen my original sales person was finished she came over and finished ringing me. I finished asking her the question I had but she was very short with me. Finally, I asked her who the department manager was.

It was a full evening of shopping --unheard with the likes of my teenage boy. But he left feeling like a well-dressed man. It was unbelievable to see the  transformation.

I've been a happy card holder for many years.\n\nHowever: I have never been more disappointed by a tailoring service. I have a very important event coming up for which I need a white dress. After scouring the store, I found one that was almost perfect--it just needed a few adjustments. The meeting with the tailor felt rushed and it didn't seem like she was paying attention to what I wanted. I tried to be vocal to get my vision across. \n\nToday, I picked up the dress (one week after the consultation) and I was literally in tears. The dress was more ill fitting than before. It was so unflattering and shoddily put together. My event is in three days, most tailors aren't open during Sun/Mon, and there wouldn't be enough time to fix it in time anyway. An expensive dress now worthless. Now I have three days to find a flattering white dress that fits my body type. I have no back up dress and I'm running the event.\n\nTailoring isn't really a member perk if it is done so poorly.\n\nI have referred SEVERAL friends to your credit member program, highlighting the alteration bonus since we are young professionals. I will no longer recommend your membership program.\n\nUpdate: I'm now spending the full cost of the dress so it can \"maybe\" be fixed in time for the event. The tailor I brought it to isn't even sure if the dress is salvageable.

Granted, some stores are better than others but they all have fabulous clothes, a great selection of make up and the shoe department usually OOC! Only exception so far is Burlington, but I spent HOURS in this particular shoe department. Yes, it is possible. I stopped in after work, during one of their sales looking for a new pair of heels. I ended up with a really sweet salesgirl, who let me know that they were currently holding a presale for a bunch of the designers shoes that would be 40% off the following week. I tried on a lot of shoes, in search of fabulous and comfortable. Which is sometimes hard to find.\n\nSo even though I had given myself a budget, that totally went out the window when I fell in love with two pairs of shoes, black patent peep toes and snakeskin slingbacks. Of course, I rationalized, I was going to get two pairs of shoes for the price of one pair. And they were both super cute! They didn't have the black ones in my size, but Nordstrom's will send you anything free of charge from another store they don't have in stock.

And totally personable. I realize a lot of it stems from the commision bit, but, hey, when that translates to making me feel like I'm their one-and-only customer, and s/he is my personalized shopper? Then, yeah, sign me up! And that's exactly how it was this past weekend when I was shopping for a new pair of flats.\n\nI recently accepted a new job (w00t!), and wanted to celebrate by buying a pair of flats that were cute -and- comfortable, especially since I fall victim to the wearing flip flops all the time when it's warm out. Pretty as my flowered sandals may be, they don't exactly provide stellar support. So with \"support\" on the brain, I headed over to the shoe section, spotted a pair of ADORABLE Cole Haan flats, and the bells started ringing. Nike Air Technology, ding ding ding! Because I wanted to make sure that this wasn't an impulse purchase, I stepped away from the shoes, and came back after strolling around the rest of the mall.\n\nConfident that this wasn't just a \"I WANT THESE SO LET ME BUY THEM\" situation, I asked the saleslady for two different colours, and she brought out a bunch of boxes for me, and I realized I needed to go a half size up, so she happily brought out another pair for me. She took the time to explain the fit of the shoe, the leather dying process, etc., and had me walk around in them, rolled up my jeans for me, so she could see how they looked on me, and I left with the PERFECT pair of flats. Thanks so much to the lovely lady with the equally lovely Burberry flats... you were a doll.

I was out, running errands, in a hurry, and I forgot that, if you would like to shop at Nordstrom, you must doll yourself up before entering, or no one will help you.  I suppose, really, that's my fault.  I was on my way to the gym, I need shoes, I stopped.  I decided not to go 20 minutes out of my way to change and do my make-up before going to the mall.  I forgot that I would be ignored and insulted as a result.\n\nSo, OK, I get it - Nordstrom is a nice store.  They generally cater to a higher clientele.  But they are also (a) in a mall, which means that anyone can wander in (especially since they're connected to the parking garage) and (b) in the service industry - so, you know, service me.  I wanted to try on a specific pair of shoes.  The first saleslady I encountered accidentally made eye contact with me, so she muttered a \"hello\" before turning away.  I continued to shop.  No one offered to help me, despite the fact that there were more sales people standing around than customers shopping.  When I finally approached someone to ask for help, he appeared offended.  I showed him the picture of the shoes I wanted (from their website, no less), and he vaguely gestured.  \"Oh, they're over there.\"  Thanks.  That's super helpful.\n\nI started to walk in the direction he indicated (you know, somewhere other than the part of the store where I was currently standing), when he called me back.  Apparently, he decided that I needed a personal escort to the shoes (probably because he thought I was going to steal something), so he called another woman over to help.  She barely glanced at the picture and said, \"Oh, we don't have those.\"  She didn't offer to look in the back.  She didn't offer to order them for me.  She didn't offer to help me find something else.  Just \"we don't have them,\" and walking away.  Meanwhile, the man I had approached for help vanished.  Awesome.\n\nDear Nordstrom:  Here's a tip.  Just because I didn't have time one day to make myself look super purty before dropping in does not mean that I cannot afford to buy your shoes.

It was $200 so I figured, what the hell? I got it and put it on, it fit like a DREAM. How lucky am I?!\n\nCut to July, 5 months later, I find myself coveting another dress I tried on a Camilla's in Arlington. After much debate I decided to return the Nordstrom dress. Their return policy seemed lax and my receipt didn't provide any guidance other than send it back or return in store. I decided to go to the store, just get it over with. I randomly happened to look at the dress online the morning of the return and noticed that it had gone on sale for 50% off. SHIT! I was convinced I just lost half my money, if they would take it back after 5 months in the first place.\n\nReluctantly I went to Nordstrom anyway.

So many places don't stock size 5, nevermind sizes 4 and 4.5, yet Nordstrom has an impressive selection of all those sizes online and in-store, and the sales associates will go out of their way to get you what you're looking for so that when you and great-grandma are pulled over on your noontime drive to It Will Always Grow Back, you won't fail the roadside sobriety test and you can therefore get to your hair appointments fashionably late rather than not at all. In addition to rescuing me from erroneous DUIs, the sales associates also rescue me from accessorizing with TP. Even more importantly, they rescue me from wearing pink glittery sneakers shaped like pony-heads-complete-with-reins. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with pink glittery sneakers shaped like pony-heads-complete-with-reins, but some occasions simply call for a sort of shoe not available in kids sizes no matter how kid-sized the feet in question might be. For those occasions, Nordstrom hasn't failed me--not even when Zappos has. Pumps, boots, stilettos, flats--they've got everything but the kitchen sink, which I wouldn't want to wear anyway.\n\nConclusion: especially if you have mutant feet, give the shoe department here a try.", "date": "2010-09-28 23:14:51"}, {"review_id": "dYCSGolvm5oo5BZuP01EYw", "user_id": "aR0QVZ3nKE8Ip8PdES_H3A", "business_id": "GPRK8YsMzly8f5P0RunMaw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This review is in regards to their Wedding Suite. We had a terrible, terrible experience at an appointment to try on wedding dresses. After two calls with the department regarding dresses we viewed online an appointment was made a month prior to try on these specific dresses as well as similar style ones in store. We made the two hour trek from our home and when we arrived the sales associates barely greeted us, and when we were finally acknowledged, we were told they did not have any of the dresses we had viewed online and discussed over the phone in store. The pulled what they considered similar styles for the bride. Once we entered the dressing room the styles were absolutely nothing like what we discussed over the phone. They even had print outs from us with exact item numbers to determine the dress and style the bride was looking for. The sales associate had minimal to say in regards to this and when she noticed we were becoming upset, she called the manager, Christina. After about fifteen minutes of waiting the manager arrives and was incredibly unhelpful. She claimed there was no way the dress we were told we would see in stores would be at their location (she was not even sure which state it was located in!) As we explained we had this appointment for a month, we made the two hour trip, and were told we see certain dresses she dismissed us instantly. We were made to feel like second class citizens from the moment she arrived, and quite frankly from the moment we walked into the Wedding Suite. She explained \"their clients\" (as if we were not clients ourselves) book appointments and request dresses to be shipped in from other locations to be seen. This is not only not common for bridal salons, it was never explained to us at any point in our conversations prior. The manager and sales associates offered absolutely no apology or explanation for the miscommunication. They seemed to honestly care less about the upset. They were cold, dismissive and outright rude. The bride left in tears. No one in our party had experienced such poor customer service before. We are shocked, horribly disappointed and incredibly upset over how the situation was handled and how we were treated.

I made a quick call to customer service to see if anyone turned it in before I made the trip back to the store.

When I called customer service, I was very pleased to hear someone turned it in! I am very grateful to whoever you are. The woman took my name down and said to come pick it up whenever i pleased. I went back to pickup my ring and spoke to the customer service manager. They were a tad bit busy since it was a weekend so I wanted patiently- I was in no rush.

For some reason, she had trouble finding it so i explained to her that the woman on the phone said she would leave it with my name. She grew frustrated not being able to find my ring and decided to ask the question \"if my ring was real or fake\" I said it was Kendra Scott so...not a real diamond or anything. She rolled her eyes and made a comment under her breath as to why I was making such a big deal about a ring when it was cheap anyways and not even real. I was shocked...this was a manager!

I was really excited and looking forward to improving my wardrobe. I called and made an appointment, and received an email asking for all kinds of information; my size, what kinds of activities I like, my age, job, marital status, kids or no kids, budget, favorite colors, and on and on. This was a great sign of things to come, and I gave as much detail as possible.\nOn the day of my appointment, I arrived and was shown into a dressing room with many items waiting for me. Imagine my surprise when the clothes pulled for me were not even close to what I was looking for, and WAY out of my price range. I know the personal shoppers work on commission, but if she had brought me 10 items for $60-$100 each, I would have been much more likely to buy something as opposed to bringing me one $1,200 dress. Or a t-shirt for $85. I also said I HATE \"trendy\" clothes, so it made me really angry when over half the stuff she had me try on was super trendy,  and when I put them on she was fawning over me, saying how \"cute\" everything looked on me. None of it looked \"cute\" or even slightly attractive. I was uncomfortable and told her so many times, but she just kept saying, \"No, you should get that, it's super cute!\" In my email I said I was NOT looking for jeans, and she had pulled about 20 pairs of jeans. Also, I told her I have a hard time wearing heels and if I do wear them they have to be wedges or something with support, and she brought me 10 pairs of stiletto heels and a bunch of ballet flats with no support. \nI felt like all my efforts to make my shopper well informed were completely wasted, and my time was wasted as well. I left with one pair of pants, and as I was walking out I saw a bunch of things I really liked and would have tried on if I wasn't so exhausted and annoyed.

In reality it's probably my favorite department store EVER. Why? Depending on the location it can carry everything from my beloved Chanel pumps to the jean shorts I like to wear on lazy summer days. The short of it is that it carries a mix of high end luxury items and everyday necessities all without the hassle of jumping between stores.\n\nWhy 4 and not 5 stars? This particular Nordstrom doesn't carry all of the Prestige brands that the Dallas and Houston locations do carry. With that said, it is a nice store to have in the Austin area. I like that I can buy the luxury items I want online and return them in store if they don't quite work out the way I expect them to. \n\nThe reason I love this location is mainly because of Paul and Francisco in women's fragrances. I've recently tumbled helplessly into a raging obsession with Tom Ford fragrances and Paul has helped steer me in the correct direction. I don't believe in buying a variety of generic and \"trendy\" scents. I'm a signature scent kind of person and in reality the more expensive and hard to obtain something is, the less people will be able to have access to it. Hence my aggressive journey into finding a \"sophisticated woman's\" perfume. I have a signature scent that I like to wear every day for work and school. It smells wonderful and is complimented everywhere I go. However the reason it's so appropriate is because it's unoffensive and non-cloying but it is distinctive. I wanted something a bit more grown up. I wanted something that clung a bit closer to the skin that was meant only for people in your immediate vicinity to be able to smell when they leaned in.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is true, smell is the strongest sense tied to memory.

It worked. The store has been a beacon of upscale Stumptown taste ever since. Shoes, sportswear, business clothes, beauty - you name it, they've got it. The problem: I don't really like their stuff. Nordstrom's clothes for men reminds me of the balding fussy uncle who spends too much on his clothes and they don't do a thing for him. Surely you know the kind of guy I'm talking about.

They'll have a spot of Boss, Zegna or Armani here and there, but for the most part, it's a lot of brands, colors, styles and textures that really don't cut it for me. Barneys this is not. \n\nI suppose there are many for whom this downtown outpost of the Seattle flagship is shopping nirvana. I've bought stuff here - plenty of it.

That means, I know firsthand how important customer service is to Nordstroms. I suck at good customer service and was reprimanded for being \"snide\" on more than one occasion.

Customer Service\". \nGrinning and baring it does not come easily for me, so the service industry is not the field I belong in. \nShort story long, I received EXCELLENT customer service at the downtown store 2 weeks ago. \nThe gist of it is this. I was co-hosting a 7-year olds \"Fashion Show\" birthday party and  my job was to put together SWAG bags for the mothers. \nFirst, I went to the WA Square Nordstroms. I asked the Lancome girl for perfume or cosmetic samples and she said that because it was between seasons, they were probably out - but took the time to look through the cosmetic drawers. She ended up finding me a bunch. \nI then went to Macy's. each girl I asked pointed me to someone else. The final stop was the lady in perfumes. When I asked for some samples, she said no. Not one to give up easily, I begged for her to look through their drawers \"Like the girl at Nordstroms did\". She coughed up one perfume sample. When I asked if there were any more where that came from (I needed 9 more) , I got a big fat \"Nyet\" (okay, not really. She said no). \nA week later, during Fashion Night out, we cruised through the downtown Nordstroms. There my friend wanted to purchase something in Cosmetics so while she was being rung up, I got to talking to the Cosmetics Liaison. \nFeeling ballsy, I asked the CL if she had any samples I could have, explaining the birthday party and my job to create \"Fabulous, To-Die For\" Swag bags.

True \"Nordi\"s understand that while Nordstrom may seem too expensive, too hoity-toity, too haute for them, in fact, there are certain staples that they excel at and have competitive prices, excellent customer service, and a really generous return policy.  I am not sure about their other policies or practices with regard to whom they fit and do not, but it is hard to imagine they would be anything other than supremely professional to any customer.\n\nThe one thing about Nordstrom that is bad is that yes, the customer service is really good.  The sales people will likely remember you, even if you don't go in often.  And they are really good at what they do.  Mostly everything they will bring you is more perfect than you could image, aside from the prices, which are actually quite reasonable for the quality of the clothes.\n\nWith regard to the bra-fitting specifically, they carry one of the widest ranges of sizes and styles of any major retailer--from 28 - 48 band, cups A-I.  Of course, there are more choices and styles in the more \"popular\" sizes, but they have more than enough for most people.  They even do a bra prosthesis program for customers in need of that service.  \n\nGetting fitted for a bra is a major \"get over yourself moment\" if you've never done it, or even if you have.  Give yourself enough time.  Don't be hungry or in a rush or too stressed, agitated, or sweaty.  Any of these will detract from your experience.  The women at Nordstrom are certified fit specialists and really good at their jobs.  \nThe first time I got fitted, the young woman assisting said she loved her job because it was like playing dress up with baby dolls.  Okay, then, play away!  She brought me all kinds of stuff that I couldn't afford to buy all at once, partially to try to upsell me and partially so she could see them on someone.  It's nice when someone enjoys there job, no?  And for someone to take you from feeling physically miserable and utterly hopeless to feeling a million times better physically and hopeful, and maybe even sexy and self-confident, well that's almost priceless.

Nordstrom is cleaner and much more organized, and all the Nordstrom branded clothing seems to be higher quality than the Macy's brands.

Over the years, it grew into a nationwide clothing chain. But it's had a mixed record balancing growth while retaining its vaunted customer-service. Yesterday, I returned to the flagship downtown Portland store Men's Shoes Department to pick up some brand new shoes I had left off for rubberized soles and a shoeshine. (Typically, I would go to the reliable Derek's Shoe Repair down the street on SW Broadway but this time I had decided to try Nordstrom again after ducking in from the rain.) The choice would turn out to be against my better judgement. \n\nThe shoes I left off aren't just any shoes. They are expensive hand-made, English boots. The nicest shoes I've ever owned. When I left them off last week, the young man assured me the boots were in good hands. I did ask him a couple questions: Who would do the work? Were they experienced in working with hand-made shoes? He said they never had any problems and would replace the shoes if there were any.\n\nI waited a few minutes at the empty counter for a person to take my claim ticket. I was starting to get that lonely feeling you can get at a Nordstrom when it seems that all the salespeople are avoiding you because you do not represent a possible sale. I finally caught the attention of a young woman who ended up retrieving the boots for me. After I paid, I felt I better look at the boots, which were wrapped in a paper bag. I knew something was wrong with them right away. The actual workmanship for the rubber soles looked a little rough but acceptable. However, something greasy had been rubbed all over the leather, they were dull and the color seemed changed and on closer examination there were black marks on what used to be a beautiful high-gloss honey-colored leather. The young woman acknowledged the grease and said I could have the shoeshine guy clean and polish them. I have to admit to being a bit stunned as I stared in disbelief at the shoes. But the best part of this experience -- and the worst part -- is yet to come. \n\nBy coincidence the shoeshine guy was clocking out and stopped by the counter. I asked him to look at the shoes. He immediately saw the problem and said he could work on them. He offered me a \"complimentary shoe shine card\" so I wouldn't be charged to try to fix the finish. He told me to leave them with the card and come back in a few days. This young man was truly the best part of the experience - albeit, I wasn't thrilled about the few days wait. Now for the worst part of the whole experience: I wanted to alert the manager to the problem with the shoes, but I was told he wasn't present. Then someone else told me he was present. Then someone pointed out another guy and said he was the manager. Confusing to say the least, but I waved him over. I wanted him to know for the record and to inform the person who did the shoddy work, but I don't think he was terribly interested in the situation. All the \"manager\" said was the clean up would be \"on the house.\" I was momentarily speechless and thought to myself: Wow, thanks dude. You mean you aren't going to charge me to fix your screw-up? I walked out shaking my head. In no way do I relish having to go back into that store again.

They used to carry my favorite toothpaste which is Go Smile but it looks like as of late Go Smile is no longer carried by Nordstroms (or Sephora for that matter).  If you can't get something in stock they will order it lickety-split at no cost.  \n\nI have also purchased tickets to their trunk events which is where they open up early and show the latest make-up and clothing fashions for the coming season.  In these events they have snacks and free samples of make-up and perfumes so be sure to keep up with the next event on schedule.  \n\nYou can also get a free Nordstroms points card that links to your bank account.  Everytime you make a purchase you acquire points for cash back on future purchases.  Throughout the year they have double and triple points events where you can rack up more points credit.  This card also works at Nordstrom Rack locations.  \n\nAnother side note is that their coffee shop that is attached to the mall entrance makes FANTASTIC coffee.  My favorite is the hazelnut latte.", "date": "2013-02-06 20:23:49"}, {"review_id": "aRpoUu4_G8f3vX_9utkj2Q", "user_id": "AbXu8lwJOmtHgQ7Y72OMhA", "business_id": "lh3DX2SbM7ZHx6xC6Zwr6g", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Men's department. Uneven service--leaning toward poor. It seems like you often get greeted ok but then it goes down hill from there. They pass you off, leave and don't come back etc. I bought a suit there last year. They never called me when it was ready. When I called and went to pick it up I saw the salesman that sold me the suit and said \"hey\" and told him what I was there for and he just motioned to the desk--could not be bothered.\nMost recently I brought in a couple pairs of shorts to have the zippers replaced (I had an alterations balance). 2 weeks later I still have not heard back (found out they had my number off by a digit) so I call them, then go pick them up. \n\nWhen I got home I discovered to my dismay that they in fact only replaced one zipper--the other pair was untouched. I call to inquire and the woman at the alterations desk just says I can bring them back to get them fixed. I've already done that once. Now I have spent $34 on getting 1 pair of $50 shorts fixed and I was not about to do that whole cycle over again. In time alone I could have had just purchased another pair (oh, is that their subtle message here I wonder?)\n\nAnother call and I get sent downstairs to a salesman on the floor who had zero idea what I was talking about. I call again and finally reach a manager-who handled everything nicely, professionally, but even then she could only credit $18. Which ok --covers the cost of being charged for a service I did not receive, but after a wasted trip to the store, having paid for services unrendered and calling and tracking them down to remedy this, when it should have been the other way around--  I would think they would just credit the whole thing and keep me as a customer.\n\nIt not just these two incidences.

The women's fashion department usually has some great stuff, but is VERY limited as far as sizes go -- they never seem to have any small sizes.\n\nI think the juniors department is actually pretty cool and VERY reasonably priced.  I always stop in to look, because they tend to have small sizes and a lot of really trendy items for a price that I can manage.  \n\nThe women's athletic department is worth mentioning, but only because I think it probably has the largest and best selection of Under Armour in Austin.  They always have the small and extra-small sizes, which are practically impossible to find in places like Sports Authority and even at Tyler's.\n\nDon't miss -- I repeat, DO NOT MISS -- the shoe sales.

Let me clarify by saying that I in no way can afford to shop here with regularity, but for a special occasion I completely feel that it's worth it.\n\nTo make an appointment with a stylist is 100% free and no purchase is necessary. They paired me with Ashley Christian who was a total dream to shop with. She called me beforehand to discuss my style, take down my sizes, and get a sense of what I was looking for. When I came in today she had 8 outfits already set up for me to try on along with shoes and jewelry to match. Short story? It ROCKED!\n\nShe was extremely personable and honest about what worked on me and what didn't. She left the room while I tried on the clothes and would then come back to give me her opinion and bring more things to try on. I put on outfits I never would have been brave enough to pick out for myself and ended up finding exactly what I was looking for. She paired an elegant black romper with a leather jacket and leopard sling back pumps and the result is downright sexy!! \n\nThe sort of clothes she would bring were a range of both expensive and affordable items. She explained that she didn't believe in having an all cheap or all expensive wardrobe. Anything pricey she brought in was more of an investment piece I could mix and match a multitude of ways, as opposed to being something I would spend a fortune on to wear once or twice.\n\nUpon checkout she also got me set up with their free rewards program so that I could earn points for every dollar there I spend. When you reach 1,00 points you get $20 store credit that you can redeem both in store and online. \n\nI feel extremely spoiled now and don't know if I can ever go back to shopping like normal folks again! The styling doesn't end after your appointment either which is the best part. Once they get a sense of what you like, they will keep their eye out and call you before a sale or if anything comes in that they think you would enjoy. \n\nI am even more excited to attend my event now thanks to Ashley. If you ever have an event, wedding, need a wardrobe update, or even want to bring in some clothes from outside of Nordstrom to complete an outfit, then book a stylist here because they will help you with all of that. I highly recommend Ashley because she was wonderful and I will most certainly be going back to her again. I think I can safely say that will be a while from now though. At least until I pay off the current balance on my credit card ;-)\n\nThanks Ashley!!!", "date": "2015-06-28 00:47:02"}, {"review_id": "4OkeuEGMHKxr61CCig15wQ", "user_id": "gkgHU2Vua3scmOZQSGehPQ", "business_id": "lh3DX2SbM7ZHx6xC6Zwr6g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "You people are obnoxious.

My otherwise sensitive skin, was barely red.  The makeup artist also highlighted my brows and I left with a perfectly natural arch.  \n\nShe also made product recommendations from the Anastasia line.  Although she was educated on these items, I felt that they were too pricey. I was also skeptical about what they claimed to do.  \nFor example: $65.00 brow growth serum. I didn't feel as if my brows are deficient and in need of a serum. \n\nThe service itself is $35.00, which seems like a lot.  Since most places charge about $15-20.00.  However, the makeup artists here are well trained.  They measure in order to get the most flattering and precise arch.  With some careful maintenence, this arch should last about three months.  Money well spent.\n\nI continued to shop the cosmetics department. The other products that I was looking for were sold out.  The sales people did make some suggestions of alternate products.  Which is great  customer service. \n\nNext stop shoes!  I specifically need a pair of boots. So the hunt was on.  I was not approached in this department.

Every year I shop presale at the anniversary sale. I understand that you need to have a Nordstrom card to shop the presale(which I do)in order to unlock the presale prices but you can pay with a different card if you'd like(i.e. my American Express). Sometimes I pay with my Nordstrom card and for other purchases I use a different card. On 7/17 I placed 2 presale orders online using cards that were not my Nordstrom card. Today I went into the store for the first time to pick up some jeans. When I went to checkout I was told I had to pay with my Nordstrom card. I told the salesperson that I had just placed an order online and I had paid with my American Express and her response was that that wasn't possible. The way she spoke to me was beyond rude and condescending and her tone was implying that I was lying. I told her that I shopped presale every year and I have never had a problem paying with a different card. She continued to tell me that I had to use my Nordstrom card to pay or else I could not purchase anything until July 22nd. I was so shocked by the lack of customer service and basic manners that I just left my purchases and walked out. I then called your stores customer service department to ask if there was a new policy change where I could not pay with a different card. After explaining the whole thing to her she also told me that I had to pay with my Nordstrom card. After I hung up with her I called Nordstrom South Coast Plaza's customer service department and asked them if I could pay with a card other than my Nordstrom card and they said yes, and that I just needed my card to unlock the screen and after that I could pay with whatever card I want. Does each one of your stores have different policies when it comes to this issue?\n            Nordstrom is known for their customer service and it is the reason that I shop there.  I am very upset with the lack of knowledge and customer service I was met with today.

I despise credit cards for each store and don't have any but this one is a debit. At some times of the year you earn double and triple points and then you get gift certificates in the mail. It just makes sense if you shop there often.\n\nIf you are parking in the Fox Tower garage, they only validate for one hour.  So, if you shop for more than one hour it will be $4.95. Also, you have to spend at least $25 for them to validate. Typically, I'm way over that and some days I'm just there to pick up alterations. They are rude and will refuse to validate unless you shopped that day. Well I'm sorry, how else am I supposed to pick up that dress? Other Nordstroms I've been to will validate no matter what if you are a certain points level on the Nordstrom's card. Which makes complete sense. If you averaged what most cardholder's spend, it would be way over $25, so you're really going to be rude to a cardholder who buys the majority of her wardrobe/purses/scarves/sunglasses and Louboutin's at your store?

I truly believe I was racially profiled today at the MAC counter. I stopped by Nordstrom in good spirits with the intention of shopping around for a few hours and treating myself to some items.

When I arrived one employee was assisting a customer while a group of 5-6 employees chatted in the corner. Since I am a former Nordstrom employee MYSELF who also worked in the makeup dept for SEVERAL years I didn't try to get their attention right away bc I thought maybe they were in a meeting. I did HOWEVER stand right by them so they would see me and tested makeup while I waited. Once they  were done talking they dispersed and not a SINGLE person came over to me. I was confused and looked around and the employees were walking around talking to each other and not looking in my direction. Then one white older lady came up (near me) and an employee immediately asked if she needed help, the lady said no and the employee walked right past me! Then white lady 2 comes up to the counter and immediately gets help, then white lady 3 and help immediately. I literally said WOW and laughed in disbelief. When white lady 4 gets help next to me I looked at 2 employees who were talking to each other and said \"UM I COULD USE SOME HELP!\"...Before I left the store I did speak to a manager who although nice did not understand my level of disappointment with this representation of the Nordstrom brand.

Yesterday morning, I punched a hole in one of my socks as I was getting dressed. I work next door in the Fox Tower so I figured I'd run over and pick up a fresh pair. When I got to the men's department, about a quarter of the collection had been moved behind a yellow tape reserved for only those with a Nordstrom charge card (they are having a preview sale for card holders). Of course the socks I wanted to look at were behind the tape. The two sales people standing guard were pretty firm that I couldn't look at the socks nor were they available for me to purchase - even when I offered to pay full price. I don't have, want or need a Nordstrom card, so I was forced to leave without being permitted to make a purchase. I'm sad about what Nordstrom has become. I studied the Nordstrom Way in graduate school and it was their terrific client-centric, above and beyond service attitude that made Nordstrom successful over the years. It's what had me coming back all those years - even early in my career when my income was such that it was sometimes a sacrifice to pay the premium prices. They've now lost their way and they've lost my loyalty over a pair of $35 socks. I will still go there if I have no other option, but I'm no longer a loyal Nordstrom guy.

I had to get out and do something about this.  Pronto.\n\nI am no stranger to Nordstrom since I believe my wifey, Suzie, has one of those rare platinum/black Nordstrom credit cards and she can go all ninja with that thing.  Many a time I have sat in the \"Sin Bin\" with the other guys while she was shopping in the gurls section.  The guys would sit around look at each other and just sigh, wondering what type of record their significant other was going to break that particular day.  One Christmas, Suz just handed me the Nordstrom catalogue with yellow stickies in it pointing out what she wanted me to buy her, I mean what Santa shoud think about buying her.  I went in, handed the catalogue to a sales gurl and handed her my Amex.  I told her I would be in the \"Sin Bin\" when she had gathered all the loot to come find me and I'll check out with her.\n\nBut, somehow, this place started to grow on me.. and when it was time for me to get my grown up clothes, Suzie dragged me out.  I had bought suits and stuff from JoS A Banks and Men's Wearhouse in the past.. hey even Burlington Coat factory had crossed my path, so that's where I wanted to go.  Little did I know she had a plan and it included good ol Nordy's... Apparently she get's frequent flyer miles for clothes now..  I started looking through the racks, I wanted a sport coat and a couple of shirts.  A sales clerk by the name of Benjamin came over and started to assist me.  I immediately told him I wasn't looking to buy car, just a sports coat.  He showed me a few and went on about what did I usually wear, colors, fabric etc.. apparently polyester is not a fabric.. who knew?\n\nHe did a really good job.  Although the TWO sports coats and a shirt I bought were a little bit more than I would usually pay, you can bet your bottom dollar they will outlast my other suits which rarely lasted a year or so.  One cool item.. as my girth ebbs and flows with the weather, they will always provide me with tailoring at not cost.

We stumbled into Nordstroms, and my daughter immediately saw the make-up consultants at various high-end cosmetic counters doing make-overs on customers. She said she'd LOVE a mother-daughter make-over. So we inquired at a bunch of counters, but all were booked up for the day (who knew it was prom night???!!!). So we realized, this wasn't going to be, our timing was just unfortunate. We wandered to the Jo Malone fragrance area (omg, that line of perfumes is SO divine!). There we met the most awesome lady (darn, I just wish I had made note of her name). In passing I mentioned that all the make-up counter folks were booked and we couldn't get make-overs but, hey, it's \"Prom night in Portland\" so it's understandable. This lady said, no, your daughter wants a make-over, I am going to find someone terrific to do it! And she did! She got my daughter - AND ME! - make-overs at the Tom Ford counter. And not only that, but the two Tom Ford cosmeticians who got us glammed up were the NICEST and incredibly skilled make-up artists I've even encountered (and the product line is incredible, which doesn't hurt!). We were treated like royalty and left there looking and feeling beautiful.\n\nThey also gave us nice-sized samples of Tom Ford perfumes (wow! Have you seen this fragrance line? It's incredible!).\n\nI wanted to treat my daughter to a Tom Ford make-up product but she declined, repeatedly. (Strange, but true). The lovely cosmetologists never pressured us to buy anything and I ended up not getting anything. But next time I need to replace any make-up, three guesses which line I'm going to buy from?

Christmas is kind of a big deal for my family. We all liked to get super dressed up.

That particular year, I was having difficulty finding anything. A friend told me about Nordstrom Rack and in my desperation, I decided to check it out, expecting to be shocked by the high prices.\n\nI was seriously surprised to find lots of quality clothes for a very reasonable price! Some things were still too expensive for me, but for what you got, it was incredible! I found several cute dresses and I wanted to take them all home with me, but my wallet wouldn't allow that. After probably 30 minutes of deliberation, I decided on one dress and directly afterwards, discovered some of the seams on the side were coming undone. Oh no! Because I had spent all that time deciding on it, I didn't want to have to do it all over again, so I brought it the attention of one of the employees here and she said they would get it fixed immediately from their in house tailor. He came out, I showed him the problem areas and he got it fixed for me in a couple minutes. Nice! \n\nLooks like you can take outside clothes in here to get fixed as well.

I am a born and raised Seattlite.  Before moving to TX, I was used to living within a 15 mile radius of 3 different Nordstrom stores (I know, I had it made in the shade..).

I don't get what is up with the beauty department at this location, but every single time I've gone there to get my beauty fix, it's a madhouse.  Which also reminds me, I asked for a sample of makeup a few days ago when I was there last, and received the tiniest, literally smallest-amount-possible sample I've ever seen.  When I got home and opened the jar to try it, I was shocked.  I actually thought the jar was empty.  After a serious \"WTF moment\", I was about to throw it in the trash, but then I saw where the minuscule amount was scraped on the corner of the jar.  There wasn't enough product to cover both of my eyes.  So basically this sales associate gave me a sample of only ONE eye(s) worth of under eye concealer...yay (said no one ever).

She is awesome) and she was able to help me work within my budget. First, she had coffee there waiting for me when I arrived at store opening on a Thursday morning. Holy freaking awesomeness! She started with about 50 items in my room and quickly pulled about half on seeing my personal style ( I tried to dress in things I liked to give her an idea). We went through the remainder to determine my best fit for different brands, and unlike other store employees, when I told her something didn't work, she didn't press me on it. Rather, quickly pulled it and  used it to help inform her choices about what she picked for me next. She was a good second eye on how a fit worked. She even helped me pick some shoes that would work with the pieces we'd chosen, and would be comfortable for me with my arthritic toe (this is not easy). I pretty much just sat down and let her do all the work. In the end, I decided to get a Nordstrom's card for the benefits it provided (free tailoring! $$ back!), and Lucy was even kind enough to do all the processing while I went and grabbed lunch at the bistro.\n\nI did experience some sticker shock at some price tags. When I finally broke down and looked at price tags, I had to break it to her that $100 was my top end on any single piece (which I should have done at the outset).

MUCH more doable). \n\nI found working with a shopper was also a good way to get an \"eye\" for what I would like in other stores, so I was able to use the knowledge I gained working with Lucy to go buy a few more pieces in other (less expensive stores).\n\nAll in all, 150% worth it.", "date": "2013-03-03 15:47:48"}, {"review_id": "ONduJoRovuHmGrCVcmRcLQ", "user_id": "kW9S9yks5Fe2SA65tb9gfg", "business_id": "lh3DX2SbM7ZHx6xC6Zwr6g", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 2, "cool": 0, "text": "So, we returned the razor... but I have a couple issues still.\nI should mention Nordstroms is great about returns.

After a 12-year+ one sided relationship, I now have a few gripe.s but i focus on 1 here. \n\nTo set the tone, I probably spend on average $500 a month at Nordies. I travel for work and often shop in other cities. I am a card holder and that supposedly comes with great perks, one for sure that is touted, ALTERATIONS. \n\nI bought this dress is Seattle last month and the shoulders / bust were a little large. I decided to finally take advantage of a Nordstrom bene, my first and have it altered so it fits perfectly. I went to my Portland store and they called alterations. The dress was pinned at the shoulders and a dart at the bust. They said the dress would be ready by 4/6 and someone would call.  No one called. \n\nToday 4/13, I went to the store to get my dress. Though I was just entering the floor an employee greeted me and asked how she could help. I told her the purpose for my visit and she went to find the dress. After about 5 minutes she came back and told me she couldn't find it but not to worry her manager was looking. \n\nThe manager called my name after another 5-10 minutes but no dress in hand. After another 10 minutes on the computer and research, the dress was found 1 department or 10 feet over. \n\nI look at the dress, all tags have been removed by alterations (call me weird but that bugs me) and notice, no darts at the bust area. The manager suggests I try it on, which I did. Guess what, my bra is still showing at the sides where the dart was not added. I'm not sure it was altered at all. The manager says she can see from the records it was but maybe it's not right. Should we call alterations again? No, I say, I thought this would be a quick errand. I tried to fit it in on a break and this dress was to go on a trip with me, leaving in under 2 days. I doubted they could pull the alteration off that fast. I left with no remedy other than to wait again for alterations.  I already spent about 45 minutes on it this time around not to mention waiting for alterations on the first appointment. \n\nPersonally, it's petty for me to waste time writing this but I've seen some declines over the years and I never complain. \n\nInternet ordering is almost always a mess\nClothing quality is declining \nThe shoe department is very small in Portland\nIt's lame that I have to have a store card to get points (for years they were unable to get my bank card working with their program so I had to get a card to get any of the benies and they did nothing retroactively for the past purchases)\nThe store staff can rarely find record of my nordstrom notes (though they're mailed I often am told I have none in file when in store)\nand alterations not so hot.\n\nSorry to say it but maybe it's time Nordies heard from someone loyal and losing that spark.", "date": "2015-04-13 21:53:51"}, {"review_id": "e6Pyn3Pemobjc1TbPInuog", "user_id": "b_EFLCO3EtsmMxkLkKovhA", "business_id": "Bd2Ytxg082yKtGcoT91HkA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "They got great cold brew.

I really do.  I love their makeup section, clothing sections, and especially their shoes.  I have a deep love for the shoe section.\n\nHowever, I do NOT like being blatantly lied to in my face by employees.  I'm rather irritated at the moment at a staff member who personally promised me something that was utterly a lie simply to make a commission out of me.  I should mention, my husband and I spend a good chunk of change at Nordstrom's.  They pretty much outfit him in his shirts and shoes.  For me, I buy (or perhaps the word is better to say bought) many of my bras and makeup here because of the excellent customer service.\n\nSo, what has upset me to the point of actually posting a review?  Over in men's cosmetics (their Billy Jealousy is the absolute best shaving cream on the planet), my husband looked at a rather expensive Gillette specialty razor.  He didn't think it was compatible with his preferred 3 blade razor blades (it was a 5 blade) but it was beautifully balanced.  The husband is impossible to shop for, so right after Thanksgiving, I went in to the men's section and looked at the razor myself.  A clerk pounced on me and explained this was the best razor system available and he only had a few left (it was $150 btw).  I explained to him that my husband ONLY wanted to use the 3 blade Gillette razor blades and had looked at this specific razor and felt it was incompatible with what he used.\n\nHe scoffed at me (or rather tsk tsked) and explained very clearly that is was absolutely compatible with the 3 blade Gillette razor blades and was modified to work with either types.  I questioned him for a couple minutes to make sure it was capable of being used with the 3 blade ones (yes, I'm positive I asked about the 3 blade ones, not other sized blades) and he promised it was.  Looking back, I think he was more interested in the sale and was saying anything to just get me to buy it.\n\nFlash forward to Christmas Eve when we are opening our presents several states away from our home in Austin.  The husband gets it, I tell him the salesman promised it was compatible and he excitedly goes up to check it out.  And of course, it doesn't work at all.\n\nNow, I have to lug it all back to Austin to exchange it (primarily because I'm not going on a wild goose chase across the country to find another Nordstroms when I live 5 minutes away from the one in Austin).  What upsets me most is this was one nice gift I got the husband this year and it was all screwed up because I was lied to by a salesperson.\n\nIt leaves a really bad taste in my mouth and makes me angry.  The main reason to even go to Nordstroms is because of the excellent customer service.

That is, until the past year.\n\nI'm a simple person, really.  But, when I find something I like, I will go to the ends of the earth to find it.\n\nIn this case, it was a Boucheron men's fragrance.  Now, mind you, I know I don't dress like the kind of person who would spritz anything more expensive than something from the last minute Christmas gift section at HEB.  Apparently, though, my nose's opening bid for colognes starts around $100.\n\nDillard's had been my go to for this item, but they seemed to be constantly out of my favorite.  So I threw caution to the wind, and called Nordstrom.   They were out, too, but they immediately offered to order and ship to my door for free.  Same price.  Can't beat that.  And it went off without a hitch.\n\nThen, one day, in the middle of Texas Monthly, I made a new eau de friend.  Or so I thought.  Viktor & Rolf were sly devils.  And, wouldn't you know, it was a fragrance exclusive to Nordstrom.  So I bit.\n\nTragically, instead of the light, innocent scratch-n-sniff fragrance that had notes of cinnamon and tobacco, the Spicebomb about blew my head off.  Both times that I wore it.\n\nOf course, I think I'm totally screwed.  Kiss that Franklin goodbye.  I put it all back in the nice little baby Nordstrom shopping bag and let it sit on my dresser for a couple of months.\n\nThen I remembered Nordstrom's famed return policy.  Certainly they wouldn't allow returns on opened, used fragrances.  Or would they?\n\nI checked their website.  Indeed they would.  I went back last night.  Yep, dressed to the threes in a Kirkland polo, Wrangler jeans, and Crocs.  The gentleman in a suit who helped me treated me as if I was wearing a tux and was their most valued customer when I said \"I hate to trouble you with a return, but...\"\n\nA moment of truth when he looked at the receipt.  Was I about to find that there was a 30-day time limit to fragrance returns?  Nope.  He simply confirmed that I wanted the refund applied to the original credit card, and proceeded with the return.\n\nHe thanked me for my business as if I'd just bought out the store.

I am sure we will find one another. Thank you\".

I asked her a few things about some items that I was wondering about, was super knowledgable in all of the products and was able to answer everything that I had questions about. She went above and beyond when helping me and really knew her stuff. She was able to help me pick out a new foundation & concealer, and also recommended a setting spray by MAC that I am now obsessed with after using it when I get home! Aside from her being extremely knowledgable and talented when it comes to makeup, she was also super sweet and had a wonderful personality. She also signed me up for Nordstrom rewards which I didn't know was a thing! \n\nAll in all, 10/10 for the Nordstrom makeup department.

I don't own much and the only suit I own was 8 years old from my wedding. Picking out business clothes is not my idea of fun and to be honest, I was dreading the experience. \nThat day was busy for your store. The shoe department, from what I could tell, had two employees working and successfully managing several people. My wife and I were picking up everything and while she has a good eye for style, I just couldn't see my existing wardrobe working with anything in her hands. At this time, Julias walked in...\nI explained the situation and waited for a look of disdain. \n\nThat of course didn't happen. Julias looked me up and down and then thoughtfully started making suggestions. He didn't suggest things that just looked good though. They were well thought out suggestions with explanations as to why the shoe would work with both jeans and slacks (as I had mentioned this during our travels around the department). Before I knew it, I had two pairs of shoes: (1) business casual; (1) professional.\n\nAfter that, it felt like a whirlwind of choices around the store. \nI had some travel coming up right away, so he helped me with two 'off the shelf' shirts in white and blue that fit me very well. He then gave me a thorough presentation of some custom fit shirts which happened to be on sale. He spent almost 40min going through the fabrics with me and my wife. I ended up ordering 5 shirts including some with custom buttons. \n\nI picked out two pairs of pants and then fitted me with an amazing jacket that, like my shoes, could work with slacks or jeans. \nLastly, he took the time out of his day to sit with me and make sure the tailor got everything just right. \n\nThe entire process took roughly 3 hours but to be honest, I was never bored. I honestly had a great time! \n\nNordstrom, this man was kind, thoughtful, hilarious, empathetic, reasonable and just an overall amazing employee. I have never had so much fun shopping. \n\nI hate shopping. \n\nI especially hate shoe shopping. \n\nHowever, I would and will 100% continue driving 35min to your location in order to specifically work with Julias.

The person who assisted me insisted on a size down than my normal size saying timberland shoes are bigger than other companies. I asked for size 10 but he stressed strongly multiple times to try size 9. I tried size 9 on, walked 10 steps and all felt fine and I purchased them.

Third week when I wore them I had very minor chaffing on my toes so I ignored them. Fast forward to now, all my toes hurt pretty bad from being bent in the shoe if I wear them to work.

Today when I went no one was at the checkout for the Sugarfina bar, and despite the fact that several employees saw me standing there in need of help, none of them stopped to help me or even ask if they could find someone to help me. After about 10 minutes of just standing there with no one helping me, I had to stop an employee walking by and ask her what to do to check out, since no one was there at the register. Thankfully she apologized and did grab a really nice young woman from Via C (I think she might have been the manager but I'm not sure) who helped me check out. \n\nThen I went to order pickup. Two employees were there, but they didn't acknowledge my presence at all and just continued their conversation right in front of me. I was like two feet away and clearly waiting for assistance--they knew I was there. Then, once the conversation was over, the woman who eventually got my package for me didn't greet me at all--she didn't say hello to me, or ask how she could help, or anything at all. She just stared at me silently, so I had to say \"I'm here to pick up something I ordered\" to get her to interact with me. She seemed annoyed and acted like I was bothering her, but I was just asking her to do her job! Then she finally gave me a bag off of one of the shelves. It was only once I got home that I realized she'd only given me one out of the two orders I'd placed to pick up! Both had my name on them, so she should have noticed and given me both.\n\nI used to be a Nordstrom employee only a year ago, and I was honestly appalled by the customer service I received (or, rather, didn't receive) today. I was taught so much better, and I put everything I could into doing the most for the customer that I could possibly do to make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.

I told her and the guy there what we were looking for... And they said \"ok. Go look over there\" (and pointed). Um...

The person who assisted me insisted on a size down than my normal size saying timberland shoes are bigger than other companies. I asked for size 10 but he stressed strongly multiple times to try size 9. I tried size 9 on, walked 10 steps and all felt fine and I purchased them. BIG mistake, I should have realised that I can't judge a shoe by walking in them for 10 steps and just trusted my instinct to stick to my regular shoe size. \n\nThe reason I didn't return them is because I didn't get to use them for two weeks after purchase. Third week when I wore them I had very minor chaffing on my toes so I ignored them. Fast forward to now, all my toes hurt pretty bad from being bent in the shoe if I wear them to work.

I wish this particular store was a bit larger, but that's really my only complaint. \n\nThis has been my go-to store for years for wonderful things that actually fit my weirdo body. Between my little feet and my huuuuuge tracts of land, I'm a hard person to shop for. To me, shopping for clothes is a painfully embarrassing chore akin to getting a root canal or going to the OB-GYN. Ughhh. But not here. \n\nNordstrom's bra department is second only to Petticoat Fair when it comes to finding bras built to hold boobies larger than a DDD. They even carry Freya bras now (lace! color! cute prints! actually in my size!), which I used to have to order off the internets from .uk. They do fittings and know what they're talking about in the size department. If they don't have something you want in the store, you can always order it in. If what you ordered doesn't fit, never fear--Nordstrom has one of the most hassle-free return policies in the world. \n\nThe rest of the store is just as fantastic. The staff is as friendly and helpful as it gets, and has a great knack for finding you the perfect thing to wear. I'm right at the height that's between petites and normal sizes, and the wonderful staff of the second floor thinks nothing of going back and forth between both sections to find me exactly what I need. They even have on-site alterations if you need them, and IIRC, those are usually free with items bought in the store. \n\nNo review of Nordstrom is complete without a mention of the shoe department. This chain started as a shoe store, and it shows. \n\nEven the cosmetics department is a collection of wonderful things. I was even able to find concealer that matched my skin back in my \"sunlight is for conformist pigs\" phase. Huzzah! \n\nThe cafe upstairs (reviewed separately) is tasty eatin', too. \n\nSometimes I feel a little buyer's remorse after spending a lot of money on something here, but then I wear it...and wear it again.....and again, and again, and again, and that totally justifies whatever I spent. \n\nI actually run into the problem of seeing *too* many things I want to buy here. That really doesn't happen very often. I really need to stay away from the purse department until the purple Kate Spade rolls off the shelves--else I see a lot of ramen in my future.", "date": "2012-05-23 03:08:24"}, {"review_id": "HFwBFBkLPpT1FDSrfFmHVg", "user_id": "INoKodiczh8-N-4l7xNeZg", "business_id": "lh3DX2SbM7ZHx6xC6Zwr6g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 2, "text": "Wow!

The sandals were called Wooden Traps, and if you hit the wood soles up against a stair or curb, they'd crack.  You always took them back - always smile, and give me a new pair.  Crazy good!

We were visiting from Seattle, Washington and was looking to purchase a Gucci handbag. We arrived on the second floor and walked into the Gucci section, not knowing that the second floor mostly held clothing and men, and waited for ten minutes for an associate to show up but to no avail. We walked out of the Gucci room and twenty feet from us a group of five associates just talking among themselves and not aiding the customers around them. Finally having their attention, we were able to head downstairs to view the designer handbags.\n\nWhile walking around through the beauty isles on the way to Chanel and Gucci, many associates were looking at us as if we did not belong. Associates did not even attempt to greet or interact with me when I was viewing the facial care, deterring me from purchasing. We felt judged due to our appearances. \n\nOur experience just kept getting increasingly worse. We walked women's accessories Gucci room knowing exactly what we were going to purchase but was just stared at afar by a older female associate, who just stood behind the cashier. Many associates were already busily aiding other customers so I happily awaited them to finish by browsing the selection. The older female associate rudely greets us with, \"Can I help you today?\" the moment I touched a handbag. She still stood behind the cashier and I was on the far left side of the room, thus she must have been watching us the entire time but she made no attempt at actually offering customer service because she did not take a step towards us. I walked to her, she continued to stand behind the cashier, and politely asked if they had a specific handbag in stock, and if not if I could order it. She took one glance at the photo I provided from Gucci and rudely says, \"No, it's too old and we don't have it.\" She did not attempt to look the bag up, did not offer other similar handbags, or offer to help anymore. I continued to attempt to show her that the handbag was still available online but she just responded with that they couldn't order it. Disappointed and discouraged, I browsed the selection to find something similar as she continued to stare at us as we looked at accessories through the glass and inspecting the display bags on our own. All the other associates were still busy with their clients and she was the only one who was not with a client or doing anything but watch us like we were doing something wrong or we're not welcomed.\n\nIn conclusion, my family did not walk out with anything from Nordstrom today. I have not felt disrespected and not welcomed at a Nordstrom before today. My family has been shopping at Nordstrom for over ten years and we do have a credit card with them. Today my family was dressed comfortably for the 85 degree weather and wore Louis Vuitton accessories but still felt judged due to our appearances. \n\nGorgeous Nordstrom store with some designer options, but the horrible customer service and experience will deter my family and I from coming back.

Checked it out because it was new.  I get that the mall is trying to get a bit upscale, but the long hallway leading to the new store is empty.  Guess they are having a hard time finding stores to move in.\n\nNordstroms is pretty standardized, but nonetheless, here is my experience.  First looked for bathrooms, found easily enough.  Noted a lot of people who looked like they didn't typically shop at expensive department stores scouring the merchandise.  I noticed a mens fragrance section near the exit, and decided to take a quick look.  I've been interested in getting a cologne for a couple years, but never cared enough to really look into it, and am too particular to just stick with the gifts I get.  \n\nRight as we approached the area, the salesperson (Sheena) greeted us, and assessed what we were interested in.  She tried getting an idea of what I'd like (which I was not helpful with) so she then moved on to spritzing little cards with cologne, over and over.  Admist the endless barage of sample cards, I noted one that I actually liked.  I am very particular (hence why I have not picked out a cologne in years) so finding a match was unlikely.  Despite this, we found a bottle shape I like, colored green, with a brand name I liked, that smelled good but not strong, and had a cool name.  (Burberry Beat, if you are interested).\n\nSurprised that I was able to find something, I decided why not just buy it.  Sheena gave me the rundown on pricing (smaller bottle $55 or so, double size $74).  Offered other items with the scent, a store credit card, etc.  As we finished, she called us over to another table for samples.  As she put it, \"I can tell by your pale skin that you have sensitive skin.\"  Now, I have really pale skin - its one of my favorite features.  But I do not have sensitive skin in the least.  But still, if you are giving me a sample...\n\nOverall, the service was what made the price acceptable.  Everything was handled perfectly, and I knew that I was paying for that service.  Yes, the MSRP on the bottle may have been $74, but online its about half that.  Now I know, but I don't regret giving a bit of commission to the outstanding salesperson.

The store where customer service comes first...unless you're not the  sales associate's customer at the Washington Square location.  At least that was the case in the children's shoe department recently.  Maybe it was an off day for the associate I had an encounter with, but it was enough to make me so sick and saddened for my two-year old daughter,  that I later returned the rain boots we'd purchased there.  \n\nWhat happened?  The actual process of purchasing the rain boots was what you'd expect at Nordstrom.  It's what happened afterward, which left me shocked and dismayed that a sales associate of this caliber could be employed at Nordstrom.  \n\nAs we were in the middle of paying for my daughter's rain boots, by the fish aquarium, my daughter saw another associate filling up three balloons at the helium tank nearby  us.  As any two-year old does, she became instantly excited and wanted one.  I told my daughter to ask the the lady for a balloon.  My daughter walked up to the lady and asked her for a balloon. \n\nThe associate told her no.  The balloons she was filling up were for other kids...her customer's three kids.  The associate then proceeded to walk back out to her customer with my two-year old following behind, with her hands reaching out for one.  Seeing this, the associate said that my associate had to make a balloon and yelled at Nancy in an annoyed tone to get her one.  \n\nIt pains my heart to see my daughter blatantly treated so rude.  How hard would it have been to spend an additional 30 seconds to blow up a balloon and give it to her?  I was standing 5 feet away and witnessed the entire incident.  \n\nAlthough Nancy did a great job as an associate, her coworker's impolite actions was reason enough to return the boots later.  I then went to Costco and purchased the same brand of rain boot for $10 cheaper, which included an umbrella and no rude associate to deal with.  \n\nI sincerely hope that this associate was having a bad day because her actions are certainly affecting customer's impressions of the entire children's shoe department.  I would encourage all sales associates to treat even their smallest customers with the same respect that they give their grown up clients.  After all, it's these parents who do the spending at Nordstrom and no parent can stand to  see their child's feelings being hurt.  \n\nBecause of this sales associate putting her sales first and hurting a 2-year old's feelings as a result of her actions,  while I, as a loyal customer, uncomfortably witnessed it all, have no choice but to give Nordstrom a one-star rating.", "date": "2012-11-07 17:48:13"}, {"review_id": "DzMtSrJlh4qGFbVSSmiJZQ", "user_id": "zE7rFPE5TTIHPp8QMSxSRQ", "business_id": "_don4edLT0XPmashiZ8vxg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I had the pleasure of being assisted by Denise in the Chanel department.

The women's section have some cute dresses, which I've purchased many of & if they don't have your size, they'll call over to another location & have it shipped for free to your home.  My husband always finds very helpful customer service in the men's sections.  The shoe department is huge but pretty expensive unless you check out the sale racks.  Sometimes, they have a piano player tap out some tunes & it sounds so pretty while you shop.

I came here with my daughter to return a pair of shoes, because within half an hour, they had caused a big blister on the back of my heel.  I was standing in line and there was a woman behind me waiting to make a return as well.  So the shoe salesman directly asks her if she has a return, and she said yes, but this woman was ahead of me (clearly).  He first mutters to the guy at the register who was on the phone, \"What?  You can't multi-task\" Then he says to me, what do you need?  And I explained what had happened with my shoes, and all he said was do you have the card it was purchased with, and I said yes, and he said put it in the machine, so I did.  Meanwhile, he tells the lady behind me that he can go ahead and process her return too.  So he does from start to finish, hands her receipt, and walks off.  I still haven't seen mine processed nor received the receipt, so I had to wait on the guy who was on the phone, and ask him to finish my return.  AWFUL!

Really good chicken sandwich - they have a few varieties of prepared sandwiches brought in every day and my fave was the chicken, havarti, greens one that has a light aioli. Big enough to eat half before work and the other half when I got cut! Other days, my best bet was the fruit and cheese plate.

I've been to this store twice.  The first time I came here, I bought a jacket.  I needed a casual jacket that would be acceptable to wear to the office.  When I got to the men's area where the jackets are, I was greeted by a friendly staff member who introduced himself, shook my hand, was knowledgeable of the products, and was able to help me quickly find a great, stylish, warm, well-stitched, designer brand jacket for $175.  Now that I've been wearing this jacket for a few weeks, I love it!  It has a nice solid feel to it, and it's warm without being too bulky.\n\nMy second experience in this establishment was less than a week ago when I needed to buy a couple of pairs of khakis.  Again, I was greeted by a friendly, knowledgeable employee (Heidi) who introduced herself, shook my hand, addressed me by my name, knew exactly what I wanted, and quickly directed me to the type of khaki I was looking for.  I was able to try these khakis on in their upscale dressing rooms with locked doors for privacy and security.  They offered free tailoring, and I just picked up the pants yesterday.  I haven't had a chance to wear them all day yet, but they fit very well and are very comfortable, unlike just about every other pair of khakis that I've worn, which are generally too tight, even when I get my size (34 inch waist).  The only concern that I may have is that they appear to be a little baggy, but then, when I met Heidi, I told her that I wanted some khakis with a comfortable fit.  But I haven't worn them all day yet, so I can't really say for sure.  I could always have them tailored if need be.  Either way, they seem to be a definite improvement over the khakis that I've bought at stores like Kohl's and other similar department stores.  Total cost for two pairs of khakis: $170, and they seem to be well worth the price.\n\nThe layout of this store is another trait to be admired.  The shelves and display cases are more spread out, creating an open and airy feel to the store, unlike the other major department stores in the South Shore Plaza where everything is crammed together, creating a more claustrophobic feel.  Also, at Nordstrom, you won't find disheveled merchandise laying all over the place.  Everything is neatly folded and placed on the shelves or tables.  Even the bathrooms are beautiful, complete with these cool, high-tech hand dryers that I've never seen anyplace else.  You place your hands down into them, into a blue light, and the quiet fans come on and dry your hands faster than the loud, obnoxious hand dryers that are located in the bathrooms in the food court of the mall.  It's worth a trip to Nordstrom just to try out these high-tech hand dryers, if you're into technology and gadgets.\n\nFinally, I have to say a good word about how the employees at Nordstrom dress.  Most of them are dressed casually, but it's stylishly casual.  I even saw one young gentleman who was wearing jeans and an untucked casual button-down shirt.  I think they do this deliberately, so they have a hip, stylish appearance to them, without appearing too formal.  But don't let that fool you.  These people are top-notch when it comes to providing you with professional, knowledgeable, and friendly service.\n\nSo, Nordstrom is my new favorite store.

Among my best finds were a leather jacket, a big puffer coat, and a pair of attractive yet highly functional boots from Doc Martens (okay that doesn't exactly back up my assertion about learning to dress like an adult -- but I bought some blouses for work as well). \n\nThis place is a fun shopping experience, and they have really delightful touches that I haven't seen before -- like the shopping carts with a convenient basket up front for your personals and a big rack for hanging your selections, rather than tossing them into a big metal bin.

Why?? \n\nA couple reasons:\n1. a variety of products at a variety of price points - you can go into Nordstrom and find something to wear for $30 and you can also find higher end/higher ticket items. It has a mix of everything. I find the 'more affordable' pieces in the Juniors section - particularly the accessories. The shoe dept is great too - you can get your $500 pair (ha not me) or find a $140 pair of boots...or $80 pair of sneakers. Variety is what it is all about! So if you only have a little bit to spend, you can find something cute!\n2. it doesn't have that 'we only cater to the wealthy atmosphere.' Again they certainly offer luxury but I don't walk in there thinking 'do I look like I can't afford to shop here?' I sometimes feel like that when I walk into Saks/Neims. And the sales people at those other stores seems to gravitate to those customers who look like they're going to spend 'the big bucks.' In short, Nordstrom is not pretentious\n3. Customer service is AMAZING. I bought a pair of shoes - wore them to a wedding, hated them. They took them back no questions. Their return/exchange policy is no stress. Sometimes I wonder how they can swing it (if people are returning clearly used/un-sellable items) - but I guess, those customer service moves keep people coming back and wanting to spend more there vs. someplace else. Also, the people who work at Nordstrom are always pleasant and willing to help\n4. online ordering is so easy and the shipping (even standard) is always quick.

I've been a few times now and have tried their Americano, Almond Milk Latte, and regular Latte and none warrant going back.\n\nTheir espresso beans (they use their own Nodrstrom brand beans) are quite bad - even more burnt tasting than Starbucks. The steamed milk in the lattes I tried was sub-par as well. You can see that they use decent almond/regular milk, but something about the way they steam it makes it taste really watery.\n\nOn the plus side, the service is good and the baristas are friendly. One thing I noticed was that they put lids on the drinks as they serve them, presumably for your convenience. However this is only really convenient if you don't plan to add anything to your drink (e.g., milk or sugar). Even though I asked for room to be left for milk in my Americano, they still added a lid before handing it to me, so I had to take the lid off to pour the milk in and then put it back on. Obviously not a big deal, but for something that you can tell is supposed to be a convenience, it sure isn't convenient.\n\nIt's important to note while ordering that the sizes are akin so Starbucks sizes. I've apparently become used to local Vancouver coffee houses that serve non-American quantities (e.g., a regular size at Revolver, Timbertrain, etc. is an 10 or 12 oz cup) but when you say medium here it's equivalent to a 16 oz \"grande\" at Starbucks. A large must be absolutely huge.\n\nI pass by it all the time, so I'll give it another shot in a couple months to see if it's improved (I know it just opened), but for now at least it's definitely not worth trying.

I was a bride that was a mess. I had been to many \"professional\" make-up studios to have trials for my wedding day make-up. Each trial was so devastating to my confidence that I didn't even want to go through with the wedding. My mom coached me into going to a make-up counter in the mall to get some ideas and to perhaps lift my spirits. I called Nordstrom to ask if there was anyone there that could in fact help me with make-up, Joe was exceptional. He heard my story and told me to come in immediately that he would be happy to work with me. I came in later that day, and he took his time to apply beautiful make-up and talk to me about the products. He was so caring and nurturing I started to cry because I finally felt beautiful. His make-up application was flawless and his pallet choice, from Bobbi Brown was incredible.  I was so impressed and happy that I asked him to do my makeup for my wedding. Joe is remarkable, he is a great person to represent Bobbi Brown and Nordstrom. He is refreshing and listens to the needs of the customer. I had the unique experience to also witness him with other customers while he was working with me and he made everyone feel special. Every customer received his full attention and time; he was meticulous when it came to working with customers and was very knowledgeable about the products. Customers were very happy with their experience. Joe is a phenomenal person and his love for Bobbi Brown products is evident. He has a passion for make-up and he makes people feel beautiful. It was important that I write this letter because I was truly inspired by Joe Gilmore's love for Bobbi Brown and Nordstrom.

I know I'm not the first full figured woman to walk into The Rack, so this was well, a big surprise.

I thought to myself, \"well, this just killed my vibe,\" and walked out.\n\nA few months later one of my friends was raving about her great finds at The Rack and told me that I needed to give it a second chance.

The Nordstrom restaurants vary in their approach: the one in San Francisco, in example, at their Market Street location is a full-service affair with a rather grand view of the city looking south from its sun-filled windows high above. The Florida Mall location however is more of a cafeteria/bistro situation where you order and pay up front but a waiter brings your food to you. This is fine, if a little confusing at first: for one, if you're paying with a credit card you pay before you even see your waiter much less have any experience with them that would determine what amount you'd care to leave for their tip. So, your only real choice is to leave a cash tip . . . even when paying with a credit card. So it is a bit awkward in all: I see no reason why since there is waiter service the waiter cannot also take the order but this is how it's done here. The setting is very nice: they've made the best use of the space and with the second-floor location, while there is not an impressive view as in San Francisco, the dining room is still sun-filled when the weather is good and the interior architecture makes the space feel larger than it really is and grander than even an upscale department store would suggest or seem to merit.\n\nThe fare offered is mainly salads and sandwiches but also a few dishes such as shrimp and grits. Both my friend and I had sandwiches, with mine being a citrus turkey and his some sort of grilled chicken sandwich. These were quite good although the fries included were lackluster and they were served with an aioli that was . . . purple. Yes, purple. Very purple and while it didn't taste bad, it looked quite odd. Orange aioli is enough of a curious affair, but a violet one is a bit much. It looked like they were trying to be innovative but it just stood out more than it ought to do so. In any case, the sandwiches themselves were very good, and that's what counts most, I suppose. We didn't try the desserts but I've heard only good things about them. \n\nIn all, this is possibly the best place in or around the Florida Mall to dine. Certainly, if you're shopping, it's a smart place to get lunch or dinner. You'll get a good meal in a very attractive setting at a fair price and not have to leave the mall nor even invest as much time as another sit-down restaurant might demand.", "date": "2013-02-17 07:57:34"}, {"review_id": "iHQJEcPtf2t2v0R5johZow", "user_id": "Nr6gzFn9yxAHB5g0tWn9jQ", "business_id": "658WjLjbdGS9s-o_iGB-eA", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I'm generally a huge Norstrom fan.

I went to find some bras today since they actually carry my [ridiculously hard to find] size and are always very very helpful. The associate who \"helped\" me today broke the pattern.

Today, I basically got a shrug and a \"sorry\".  I was flabbergasted, to be honest.  I've never been out of the store so quickly!

On July 25th, I attempted to return the shoes, one of which killed my feet. I never wore them outside of my bedroom, as I was trying to figure out if these shoes worked for me.They have a newer policy where you need to have sales price stickers on the shoes, not worn and sales receipt.  I don't shop enough there to know how strict they were on this.  I just figured they could look up my account and it would show I purchased on my Nordstrom card.\n\nShopping that day, I was in a hurry and not knowing the policy picked up a pair of shoes that didn't have stickers on it.  Since I am assuming that shoes are new and not worn, I didn't think to look at the bottoms of the shoe, or make sure they have stickers.  I just figure they are new!  \n\nI showed up to return the shoes. \n\n1.  They told me no sales price stickers, no luck.  If this is the policy, why did the clerk sell these to me without stickers?  \n2.  They told me I had worn them...not.  But someone did, just not me.  Why would i think to check this when I bought?  It was not apparent on trying them on, and I'm not shopping at Goodwill.  I just figure the product is new.  \n3.  They said i didn't have my receipt, and said there was no record on my account, and even if they could find it, it would not list the SKU numbers, etc... HOWEVER, I did not have a problem when I called customer service.  Customer service promptly gave me all information, including every bit of information about what I had purchased.  \n\nThe other issue for me is they treated me like I was pulling something on them.  Nothing worse than someone pegging you as a criminal.  Manager just smiled sweetly as she told me to basically take a hike. \n\nMuch of the merchandise at The Rack looks like it's from Goodwill.  The prices on discount racks are extremely high for years old merchandise that is so beat up it should be at Goodwill.  I did not think to check the quality (New/Used) on the racks, but YOU SHOULD!  \n\nIn summary, I think they returned a worn pair of shoes and put them on the rack w/ no sticker.  Now they want me to pay 100.00 for a pair of shoes I can't wear.  \n\nTAKE A HIKE NORDSTOM RACK!", "date": "2017-07-28 01:15:38"}, {"review_id": "S_aM38bHZQdOUK_NATts9Q", "user_id": "euHaL6qnJVCnofHP5i3N8w", "business_id": "ep4Zt5fmVByFv8yhDx5ZUA", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "I went shoe shopping for the three granddaughters.

This review is in regards to an employee who needs to work a little harder on his customer service.\n\nThe younger, slender gentlemen to whom I believe another employee referred to as \"Chino\" or a similar sounding name, should review the doctrines that Nordstrom has come to be known for in regards to their level of customer service.\n\nIn short, I purchased a Nordstrom-brand shirt off of a rack that was clearly labeled \"2 for $24\" and in smaller print under that \"$12.97 each\".  Seems like a simple and clear concept to follow.\n\nI brought my shirt to the cashier, a nice older woman who was very helpful, and she proceeded to ring me up.  I wasn't aware that the shirt I brought up was missing a tag, so she sent someone to go get another shirt to complete the transaction.  For whatever reason, 5-7 minutes passed and there was no sign of the employee, so I told the cashier that I could walk over to the rack, which was in my line of sight from the register, and bring another shirt, albeit a different color.\n\nI proceeded to do so, and the employee she had sent to fetch a shirt, returned as well and stayed by her side.  She began to print out another tag so that she could complete my transaction (so the shirt I was actually buying had a tag and proof of purchase I assume), and when she asked the employee next to her about the cost, he said \"$13.97\".  To my surprise, I looked at the tag of the shirt I brought to her and sure enough it did say $13.97 each or 2 for $24...a different price than the sign that was on the original rack.\n\nI proceeded to tell the cashier that the sign said $12.97, even though the tag said otherwise.  After having to repeat myself because the employee looked confused, I said \"I don't really care, it's only a dollar difference, but I just want you to know that the sign on the rack says $12.97 each, not $13.97.\n\nThe employee looked at me and said, \"well yes, it's $12.97 if you buy two, but since you're buying one, it's $13.97\".  WHAT?!  Um, actually if you buy two, it's $24.00, not $25.94 as your logic would have just implied.....\n\nHe proceeded to go on and say something like \"If you go to a different rack, like accessories or bathmats, you'll see that we do a lot of buy 2, get this price...blah blah.\"  Annoyed at this point, I looked at him and said \"I understand the concept of purchasing 2 for a certain price and having to pay more if you buy just one, what I am telling you is that your sign says a price, and your shirts on that same rack say another.  I just want you to know that in case another customer comes up and complains that you are charging them a dollar more for this item, when the rack clearly says it's a lower price\",\n\nHe just looked at me and said \"O....KAY\" in quite a bitchy tone and walked away.  The older cashier seems embarrassed by the exchange that just happened and was clearly apologetic.  She understood what I was trying to say.  Before she handed me the receipt, I saw the other employee standing in front of the sign for an extended period of time, just staring at it.  Was he confused???\n\nEnd of the day, it's a dollar...that I could care less about. Regardless of if this kid was either too proud to admit that the price on the rack was different or possibly too stupid to understand what I was trying to tell him, he shouldn't have resorted to the immature, bitchy reply and walk away.\n\nAgain, even though I don't care about the money, you could have honored the $12.97 pricing to quell the situation.  Anyway...still a good store and have always encountered other employees with better customer service skills, but I will certainly avoid that guy's register in the future.", "date": "2014-01-15 01:20:13"}, {"review_id": "2x4HEkp069-wOMo9ZLJ8Uw", "user_id": "ogpIxjkX7cJkKDeCxr1BVg", "business_id": "kvuLtLj-MngSgIPEPTVrig", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 5, "cool": 0, "text": "The staff there does not even know how to make a green tea latte, and they are serving with a pompous attitude.

I left feeling degraded and poorly treated. \n\nFirst of all, the store was mess. I came specifically for shoes, and sure they had a bunch but they were haphazardly placed in piles on the shelf rack. It looked like a drunk garage sale. It was so hard to shop in all the disorder. \n\nEventually I found the shoes I wanted. However the sizing was off and so they fit both my feet differently. I went to the front to ask the cashier a question. I stood there at one of the two registers. One associate was available but ignored me. I thought maybe she wasn't ready yet so I waited until she called me up. Then a couple walked right by me and started to check out at register I was patiently waiting for! All the while, a security LP guard stood there watching all of this and didn't say anything. (I thought they were suppose to be focused and aware!) \n\nSo anyways, I let it go and continue to wait. I ahve to say It was the longest wait Ive ever had for a store that wasn't even busy!! There were 3 cashiers but they must've all been in training because they were taking there sweet precious time. Finally the couple that cut in front of me left. SO I walked up and put the shoes down to ask a question. ALL of a sudden the security guard rushed towards me! He says \"sorry, you weren't next in line.\" \n\nOh bullshit, I thought! I told him the couple just cut in front of me and I was waiting there the whole time. All I had was a question. \n\nHe said I wasn't behind the blue \"line starts here\" sign. Which I didn't even know was there, plus when I came to the registers no one was around, blue sign or not. And since when did this blue sign rule become \"do or die\"? So ridiculous. What ever happened to customer service and the customer is right???\n\nSo the security guard backed off and I asked the lady my question. Remind you, I am a very friendly smiley person, and I expect to be treated nicely back. But this young lady was completely rude and inconsiderate. I wish I had gotten her name. She answered my question but with the worst attitude.  I smiled politely and she just looked right back at me like I just killed her cat! \n\nI left the counter, threw the shoes back and left.

When you work at a department store, mall, or any sales position for that matter you don't just have to have people skills, it is a MUST. You also have to treat people EQUAL! To the General store manager, in my honest opinion instead of responding to all the negative reviews on this site maybe you should hold training opportunities for your employees to better their people skills that are clearly lacking, for the most part. I have shopped at Seattle area Nordstrom's and have never found this level of blatant rudeness, I can completely agree with a reviewer who stated that you will only get treated fairly if you \"look wealthy\" or make it known that you will be spending a significant amount.

He actually brought me out a sample and it was very good! \n\nI ordered a cup of the Crab Bisque and the Citrus Turkey sandwich.  The bisque had nice chunks of crab in it, and was super yummy.  But, the main star was DEFINITELY the sandwich.  This sandwich was hands down the best i've ever had.  I'm salivating just writing about it.  The bread was fresh, with the turkey, citrus chutney, and garlic aioli was a total winner.  It was like thanksgiving on a sandwich.\n\nMy Mom got the Blue Cheese and pear sandwich, and unfortunately the woman who rang her up only got her a 1/2 salad rather than the full.  My Mom was wondering why it was so small and ended up eating some of my sandwich. :) Our waiter, Scott, brought this to our attention, and even though my Mom ordered a whole salad and only received a 1/2, he offered to bring another 1/2 out free of charge.  \n\nThe service was great, the food is great, and I can't wait to go back.  5 stars, easy.", "date": "2013-05-06 13:46:59"}, {"review_id": "AWm-DL46I5P_ZF6jDrI3Lw", "user_id": "N_79TyhstGjhu-A9J_hnBQ", "business_id": "ykrwAVW9Hx94H_ATuuLQTw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I bought my daughter a pair Birkenstocks for her birthday.

BUT if there is some kind of agreement to stock a product, and honor it's manufacturer return than it seems like they'd have to do so? The cashier I dealt with was very helpful and she went above and beyond offering to call Haute Look for me to ask if they'd return it. But the manager at the store was very short, curt and almost rude with me. She didn't really seem to care whatsoever, but she acted more like I was wasting her time. I spent 30 minutes + back and forth to the store, and now I've spent almost another 30 minutes on the phone with Haute Look and it seems like it comes down to Hunter honoring the return since it was purchased through an authorized stockist, but save yourself the headache, shop Hunter direct, and shop their sales. But the customer service the manager at Rack offered was lackluster at best. I'll spend my money elsewhere if the customer service is that bad.\n\nI called Haute Look myself, and the representative worked tirelessly to fix this issue for me. Hunter Boots themselves replaced the boots for me with a new color (they didn't have the color I originally purchased,) at full retail price (I paid $89.99 from Rack and I got $140 boots from Hunter.)

This Nordstrom Rack usually serves up the latter, but sometimes it can tend toward the former. \n\nIn general, the men's section of this Rack is pretty well organized, and decently well-stocked. As opposed to the downtown location, the stacks here are not nearly as chaotic, rifled through, or disorganized. During the midday hours, there are usually few other dudes shopping in this section, so it's pretty easy to navigate the aisles. The dressing room is only attended about 70% of the time. Otherwise, I have no complaints about the service. \n\nOn the down-side, the daytime hours are when the elbow-happy housewife/stay-at-home-mom/unemployed/whatever contingent comes out to play. Ruthless, hungry for name-brand clothing at closeout prices, rude as fuck and with nothing better to do, these ladies swarm like piranha. Sometimes they enter the mens section of the store (obviously shopping for the husband/boyfriend/kids). This is when my shopping experience goes down-hill, fast. They rifle through piles leaving a wake of unfolded clothing with sizes and brands all mixed in a disarray of designer denim. They have no problem shoving into a rack right next to you and sometimes even just pushing in front of you. On occasion, only my sheer will-power has kept me out of jail and left these lovely people alive. I'm not sure how a 35% discount can bring this out in humanity, but it does. \n\nI digress. \n\nMy mission is to get in, shop the brands/sizes I like, and get out. When customers screw up the pretty decent organization that this store has going on (which is much better than most Rack locations), it makes my shopping experience so much harder. Add in some rude shoving, and it gets annoying. I don't have hours to kill, and I don't give a shit if you do. GTFO of my way. \n\nWeekends here are a nightmare. Whole families (the driven, ruthless wife, the disinterested other half, and the annoyed kids) clog this place and bring the above-mentioned chaos. I avoid. \n\nThe slowness of the check-out staff during the midday hours can be a tad frustrating as well, and almost has me dropping this to a 3-star review. But they're friendly enough, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo... bling-encrusted torture device, or discount clothing store? I guess it's all about the attitude you take in and the amount of zen you can find for yourself amongst the rows hangars while someone is trying to beat you to the best hidden deal on the nearby rounder. \n\nGood luck.", "date": "2009-04-29 03:30:20"}, {"review_id": "BkYWKUf30eb70m2Qxpdyfw", "user_id": "Ty9gWdFWh8Ka8ChN2FLovA", "business_id": "_don4edLT0XPmashiZ8vxg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Well, here I am reviewing a clothing store, wtf self.

I complained to another Nordstrom employee who said, \"this is not the first time she has done this.\" \n\nSo here's the story of what this bigot did: \nI came in to shop around for shoes with a friend. She did not bother to ask my friend and I if we needed help with anything even though it was obvious that we were waiting around and looking for someone to help us get shoe sizes. I watched Milena with her arms crossed talking to another female employee looking back at us with a look of disgust. So I decided to find a different employee to help us and that is when I discovered this was not the first time she has treated customers of color so poorly. He then walked us over (since he couldn't leave his department to help us) to get her to help us grab shoe sizes. She rolled her eyes and walked over to us asking what size we were looking for. She went to go grab the shoes and made sure to take extra time in doing it. Then, she came out with the boxes and decided to aggressively toss them on the ground, looking at us with a look of annoyance. We must've looked shocked because our facial expressions made her ask us, \"WHAT? You want to sit somewhere else or something????\" \nI told her \"No???\" At that point, I wanted to lose it and yell at her but I remained calm and tried on the shoes. As we were trying on the shoes, I observed her helping customers who were not people of color and treating them as if they were royalty-getting down on one knee to place the shoe boxes on the floor for them, taking the shoes out of the boxes for them, asking if they need another size or help with anything else all while trying to see if we were looking back at her to see that she treats white customers one way and colored customers a different way. It was at that moment, I realized what was REALLY going on. I watched her behavior when a man of color walked into the area shopping by himself and she did not even bother to approach him either. Milena G is a racist bigot and I took this to corporate level, I even explained to them that another employee told me that this was NOT the first time she has discriminated against people. The regional manager (Debbie Hartley) told me that she would face corrective action. Nordstrom has done nothing to solve this issue because she is still working there, still discriminating... still ignorant.. still an idiot.

I feel like I'm being attacked when I walk into that area. Last time I shopped there a very sweet blonde girl with long hair was the department manager and out of everyone I've come across in women shoes, she's the only truly nice person there who I like getting service from. (She'd also helped me previously in womens lingerie department). As for the other shoe salespeople, I have found they are not memorably friendly.\n\nThe mens shoe department is great, however, and the employees are helpful and friendly and they always seem to have time for the customer.\n\nWomens Lingerie department is great. I would highly recommend getting professionally fitted by one of the salesgirls there. It changed my life! They carry a lot of larger cup sizes with even small bands. It's a dream place to go if you can't find bras anywhere else. \n\nThe MAC counter seems to be short-staffed much of the time when I'm there. It all depends on what MU artist you run into but generally they are friendly and helpful. There are a couple I've had help me that seem unfriendly and I try to avoid them at all costs.\n\nI've tried to get assistance in a few of the women's jeans areas on the main floor and that's always a challenge to try to find anyone to assist me.

It's very hard to get off, and it pretty much ruins the insole. When I got home, I tried to get the residue off with rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab.. (I know.. very dumb move) - and the result was a mess. I brought the shoe back, and ask to speak to the store manager.

The person who was flagged down was named Melody and works in the perfume section.  The impression we had based on our experience with her was that she seemed frustrated and annoyed when we asked the price of an item.  She said she would have to go over to the price scanner to look it up.  \n\nWe asked if there was someone else who works in this section that we should have help us instead.  Melody said the person who works the Clinique counter was on lunch and that she was covering as they usually do during lunches.  She informed us of the price of the item, and the person I was with told Melody which items she wanted to purchase.  In the middle of talking to us, Melody turned around, and went to introduce herself to the people who had walked into her perfume section to ask if there was anything she could help them find.\n\nAfter addressing people in the other section, she came back over and apologized.  At that point we left the store without making a purchase, because clearly, we felt our time and money were not being valued.

They type of crap they sell is not a decision made by the employees, nor the management, in that particular store. Those decisions are made elsewhere in a land far, far away. So those that are knocking stars for price or selection are barking up the wrong tree. Find Nordstrom Corporate on here and throw them a dumpy review.\n\nWhat matters in a specific store location is the quality of the employees as well as the manner in which the merchandise is recovered and presented. \n\nI like this Nordstrom best (by the way, there's no S on Nordstrom, people!). It's easy to navigate, there are associates willing to help everywhere, and the place is always relatively spotless in my experience, even on a busy Saturday. \n\nRecently, I was meandering around the shoe department and noticed a beautiful pair of all-leather black tall boots without zippers (for which I have been pining for MONTHS), on sale for $80! What a steal! Unfortunately, they did not have my size. A lovely woman (little older, has an accent) said she could order them for me and whisked me away to the counter. Because I only had a check and she was doing an online order, she had me buy a gift card with my check and then use the gift card on the order.\n\nA few days later, the boots came in, and one was way smaller than the other. Bummer, but it happens. Factory defects are a thing of life. I called the Nordstrom customer service phone number and they could not re-order a replacement pair for me because these particular boots were no longer available. She put me on hold, called the store, and spoke to an associate on my behalf, who assured her that they could help me. Good service from her too, even if she couldn't help me.\n\nWent back to the Northshore location, and the same woman was there. I told her I now wanted a pair of tall Paige Frye black riding boots in a 9, but they weren't available online or anywhere else, so I was S.O.L. A little frustrated, I told her I would just return the boots and take the giftcard, since that's how I had paid. I knew from experience in my own store that you can only get refunded in the manner in which you paid -- even though I bought a giftcard with a check, ultimately, I had paid for the actual boots with the giftcard. But no! This woman says, \"do you want cash?\" and I am stunned! She said she remembered me from the first transaction, remembered I had used a check, and would give me the cash back for the boots. Talk about service! I know it's a small thing, and it's just cash, but it's that little bit extra that makes a world of difference. \n\nA reminder to me that quality may cost a bit more up front, but it's an investment in great service, longevity, and a company that stands behind their products.

I bought a bunch of hair clips, rubberbands, and a headband, some for myself, some for my mom, this weekend.  We do not buy things made in China, and to my delight, I found a wide array of hair accessories made in France, so I bought a bunch of things after calling my mom and consulting her on what she wanted.\n\nThe line at the registers was kind of long, so an associate was calling people over to the side if they were paying by credit or debit, and I was.  He scanned the items with an iPhone attached to a scanner.  I have to admit, it was a little weird to have a guy ring up my bras and know my exact size (I'm fairly well-endowed, and until now, I didn't think about how creepy it can be for a guy to ring up bras and know your size, since guys never work in the lingerie department at places like Bloomingdale's!).  \n\nEither way, I was unpacking all the things yesterday, and I realized I was charged for a hair clip that was not in my bag.  It was only $5, but it would cost me more than $5 to drive back to Natick/Framingham from Medford to get a replacement or a refund.  I called up Nordstrom Rack, and the gentleman I spoke to (George) had me read him the barcode at the bottom of my receipt.  He looked up the receipt with me, confirmed I did not receive my item, and he refunded my money back to my credit card, no questions asked, so I really appreciate the great service rather than a hassle, and that earned the store a positive review!", "date": "2013-05-15 12:56:48"}, {"review_id": "rXuPNwEAw0z-DDjN1SGwTg", "user_id": "zsuRVS8-rHGIUBtyGEfEQQ", "business_id": "uaBmX85Hqv43kV3KyeSOzA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I went to Nordstrom's at Phipps Plaza this past Saturday approximately 4pm. My intention was to buy $125 bottle of Christian Dior Addict the original. Only the most expensive Dior perfume they sell. The first person I encountered was a woman working the Dior counter. I asked her specifically for this and she said she's been working here for years and has no idea what I'm talking about. I looked behind the counter and low and behold there was a bottle of the original addict in blue bottle as always. She states to me that this must be new. I laughed and said it's been around for about 12+ years. She couldn't find it anywhere. Then a gentleman comes up and he too says I don't know what you're talking about I've never heard of it. Meanwhile I am standing with the bottle in my hand that was behind their counter. Then yet another woman comes up and says isn't that a men's cologne and I said no it is been around for 12+ years it is the original of the Dior Addict perfumes. So finally I had got so frustrated that my voice got a little bit loud and I pulled a Ramona singer stinger from housewives of New York City. I literally looked at my boyfriend and said are you flipping kidding me, I looked at the sales people and said are you kidding me. By this time I had eight sales associates looking at me and about five customers. Then the original sales associate says I can order it for you online I have all the information here. I said you do not have all the information here because I haven't given you my information and I'm not going to because of the way that I have been treated. To which I said by that I mean it is really sad when you have three sale associates Who know nothing of the product that they sell and the customer knows better than you do. I said why am I not making $15 an hour behind this counter instead of you. I told them I will gladly go home and order it online myself. I am so disappointed as Phipps Plaza is one of the most expensive malls not only in Atlanta but in the state of Georgia and maybe in the Southeast region and your Nordstrom's sales associates do not even know the products that they're employed to sell. This is not only sad it is unacceptable. Corporate will be hearing from me.\n\nPs and I look online and it says it is available for pick up at Nordstrom at Phipps Plaza yet no one knows what it is and they don't have any in stock. So hello MACY'S here I come and I gave them my $125 and walked home with my Christian Dior addict that I originally wanted. And that was thank you to Sharika at Saks Fifth Avenue who looked up on her phone and found out that they actually had the product at Lenox mall Macy's across the street.", "date": "2017-06-09 12:11:21"}, {"review_id": "q4JFCwt0MGCyKKb4h6afuw", "user_id": "I85HG2hja3RjZYJCEAS70A", "business_id": "22joiy0vlbDJsutbghgOOQ", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 5, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Brides beware..

My intention was to buy $125 bottle of Christian Dior Addict the original. Only the most expensive Dior perfume they sell. The first person I encountered was a woman working the Dior counter. I asked her specifically for this and she said she's been working here for years and has no idea what I'm talking about. I looked behind the counter and low and behold there was a bottle of the original addict in blue bottle as always. She states to me that this must be new. I laughed and said it's been around for about 12+ years. She couldn't find it anywhere. Then a gentleman comes up and he too says I don't know what you're talking about I've never heard of it. Meanwhile I am standing with the bottle in my hand that was behind their counter. Then yet another woman comes up and says isn't that a men's cologne and I said no it is been around for 12+ years it is the original of the Dior Addict perfumes. So finally I had got so frustrated that my voice got a little bit loud and I pulled a Ramona singer stinger from housewives of New York City. I literally looked at my boyfriend and said are you flipping kidding me, I looked at the sales people and said are you kidding me. By this time I had eight sales associates looking at me and about five customers. Then the original sales associate says I can order it for you online I have all the information here. I said you do not have all the information here because I haven't given you my information and I'm not going to because of the way that I have been treated. To which I said by that I mean it is really sad when you have three sale associates Who know nothing of the product that they sell and the customer knows better than you do. I said why am I not making $15 an hour behind this counter instead of you. I told them I will gladly go home and order it online myself. I am so disappointed as Phipps Plaza is one of the most expensive malls not only in Atlanta but in the state of Georgia and maybe in the Southeast region and your Nordstrom's sales associates do not even know the products that they're employed to sell. This is not only sad it is unacceptable. Corporate will be hearing from me.\n\nPs and I look online and it says it is available for pick up at Nordstrom at Phipps Plaza yet no one knows what it is and they don't have any in stock. So hello MACY'S here I come and I gave them my $125 and walked home with my Christian Dior addict that I originally wanted. And that was thank you to Sharika at Saks Fifth Avenue who looked up on her phone and found out that they actually had the product at Lenox mall Macy's across the street.\n\nUPDATE Manager Stephanie called upset by my experience. Neither corporate nor the store manager apparently give gift cards. Now I'm awaiting call from Kenya who is to put a package together for me free of charge to get me back in. Also there were two bottles available at this Nordstrom day I was there staff didn't know product or how to look up. \n\nHopefully Kenya will give me product of original addict as I cannot just wear any old perfume.

As she has uniquely enormous breasts on a tiny frame it's sometimes hard to fit her (Victoria Secret last put her in a 32DDD!) When she originally purchased the dress, she hesitated for her fear of having to wear a strapless bra underneath as they never do the trick.  The bridal shop gave her a corset bra to try on with it that held her up in a way she had never before felt supported. The tightness from the girdle/stomach portion contributed to overall support.\n\nWe searched the mall extensively for something of this nature but had quite a bit of trouble and our last stop was Nordstrom's lingerie department.  The girl at the register had an attitude when she asked us what we were looking for,  (rudely asking \"Why do you need that?\") and even though she had a few to show us, strongly urged my mother to try on one of their strapless bras that she swears by and Spanx. She handed us a few of the corset bras which seemed as though the size wasn't just right, handed us a strapless bra, and began looking in the computer to see if she could order one of the corset bra's in the appropriate size. Her tone was condescending and rude when we insisted on the reasons for wanting the corset bra, and even argumentative, trying to tell us that what she was recommending was better. \n\nWe agreed to give it a shot and put the strapless bra on my mom and her boobs promptly sagged to her belly button much to her dismay. Next we tried on the corset that was probably going to be too small... but it surprisingly worked very well. When we went to the check out the girl was so busy ordering the corset in the size we'd originally thought was best, and actually rung the transaction through when I realized the prices didn't match up. I pointed out her attention to this, and she almost still didn't connect that we wanted the piece we had tried on, and not one that needed to be shipped.  I'd specifically said, \"we'll take this\" as I handed her the piece but she didn't bother to listen.  She had to cancel the transaction and start over, barely apologizing for her dismissive behavior.\n\nWith a fake smile, she sent us on our way with a feeling of being brushed off and mistreated.  She was rude and condescending, and if I ever have to visit Nordstrom's Lingerie department in the future, I can guarantee it won't be at this location.  She seemed to be even making the young girl working alongside her uncomfortable with mean glances and what appeared to be giving her orders/instruction.\n\nI've never had such a bad customer service experience at Nordstrom's.

He gave me the hair dryer for Christmas, which was a surprise. I knew how very expensive this item was, and I really didn't expect it, but have used it since the first week in January 2018. I did not keep the storage box or several of the tools that come with this hair dryer. We travel sometimes, and frankly, the storage box and the tools were unimportant to me. He purchased this dryer for me, expecting it to be the best, and we specifically saved the Nordstrom store receipt in case of any issues with the dryer.\nToday, right before we were getting ready to run a ton of errands, as so many people do on a Sunday, the Dyson hair dryer stopped working just as I was in the middle of drying my hair. This was extremely frustrating, but I told my husband, \"you know what, I saved the receipt\", as I always do so with most everything that we purchase. That's what I hope any smart consumer would do. We packed up the dryer along with one of the nozzles that I had kept and the Nordstrom receipt. The carrying case, and one or two of the accessories went into the garbage when I got the dryer. My husband purchased the Dyson hair dryer FOR the hair dryer, NOT the case, NOT the accessories, for the dryer. The first Assistant Manager that we spoke with in the store was totally disrespectful to us. She told us if we did not have the carrying case or the accessories, SHE COULD NOT HELP us. Period. End of Story. We were dumbfounded, and frankly really surprised that this individual would not help us with our issue. We had the NORDSTROM receipt containing all of the information that she needed to help us. We asked if we could come to some kind of compromise, even if it was only half the value that my husband originally paid, which was $435.59. She refused to help us. I told her I could now understand why Nordstrom was not doing well as a whole and that I had been a Nordstrom customer for 30 years, and I would never shop at Nordstrom ever again. I looked at my husband and said, \"I need to get away for a minute\". I was so stunned and angry that I needed to walk away, so my husband stayed in the store continuing to voice his dissatisfaction with this kind of customer service. \nI walked to the middle of Phipps Plaza, angry and upset. Then I called your Nordstrom 800 number. Thank goodness, I did that. The associate on the phone was extremely kind, I explained how frustrated we were, and I asked if she could connect me to the store manager, which after a few minutes on hold, she did. I was connected on the phone to Lanece Malone, and asked her if she could meet me over in the handbag area. I explained the entire situation to her, just as I had to the other assistant manager. I explained that my hair was half way wet, and I pulled my thick hair into a pony tail, and that, really, with all the errands we were doing today, the last thing we needed was to get into it at Nordstrom over a return that WE HAD A RECEIPT FOR. After we explained all of this to Lanece, she was kind and professional, and she unexpectedly processed a refund for the entire amount of the purchase. We were pleasantly surprised, yet still so frustrated at the way the other associate handled the situation. Lanece knew how to handle the situation for us, but sadly,the other assistant manager did not.\n\nAs we were leaving the store, we saw the first assistant manager who was so awful to us, at the customer pickup area near the doors to the store, and I mentioned to her that we returned the dryer. Continuing with her awful customer service, she basically said that we pulled one over on Nordstrom and we got to keep the accessories and carrying case from the Dyson hair dryer. What a terrible way to have us leave your store. Retail stores all over the country are doing poorly, closing their doors (Ralph Lauren, Belk at Phipps Plaza and Jonathan Adler are a few that come to mind that have closed in the last few months), and customers are not coming back, why on earth would any associate, an ASSISTANT MANAGER, no less, treat anybody like this?\nI trust this is not the way that Nordstrom wishes to conduct business with valued customers--I have been shopping at Nordstrom for over 30 years, well before you were in Atlanta AND I have now torn up my Nordstrom Card, probably forever!", "date": "2018-06-25 22:34:51"}, {"review_id": "Swh-MqxjgDJKnAPWpeqT1A", "user_id": "QmCSxOkOt9srquRDFw_oOQ", "business_id": "uaBmX85Hqv43kV3KyeSOzA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "When shopping at Nordstrom I expect the best customer service and the best atmosphere.

I finally found the area only to see there was no one available to assist me. Now what?  Aha.... Another associate passing by. Ok, so I then asked for help & got some. She asked my name & found the bag and gave it to me. No ID?   That seemed odd...but this whole trip has been strange. Nope, no ID necessary... and not a thank you for shopping.... really? \n\nSo, I turned around and left  the store. While in my car I thought : What just happened?  This is Nordstrom...not Walmart. I am well aware of the pandemic... Yes, they could be short on staff. And from what I could see there was barely any stock in the store...

I walk into the men's department and don't immediately see the wallets, while holding the dress, and the only sales associate I see is the one from the night before. I simply ask him where the wallets are located, again it seems like I've disturbed him and he walks out from behind the counter and gestures towards the wallets. After looking around for a second I walk back over and ask him if it would be possible to return the dress and buy a wallet in the men's department. His first response is, \"No.\" He then said, \"We'll yes, but it is a lot of work for me. You seem fit, it would be easier if you go upstairs to return it and then come back down to buy the wallet.\" This is the point where I decided I have inconvenienced him enough for one weekend; I go upstairs and with true Nordstrom's customer service and have no problems returning the dress, and then left the store. I refuse to support a store or a salesman's commission with my money when I've been treated like such a nuisance.

I walked by multiple employees and every single one was on their cellphone, not paying attention. You'd think with all of your display tables empty you'd want to make sure that you make up for it with proper customer service, but that would require not hiring phone addicted 18 year olds so you'd probably have to nut up and pay a tad more than minimum wage. \n\nIn any case, upon being helped, I asked for adidas and the gentleman didn't even walk me to where the 5 pieces of adidas clothing were (no joke - 3 of the same T-shirt and two pairs of shorts). He points, from halfway across the store and expects me to see where their miniscule adidas section is. Then, when I ask when they will have more stock, because ordering online isn't something I like to do, he cuts me off and tells me to go to Macy's.\n\nSo I went to Macy's, and guess what?

It's just not going to happen. But since I lost all this weight, I decided to go give the men's section a renewed perusal, now with a fresh pair of eyes and a waistline that is no longer approaching explosive critical mass.\n\nUnfortunately, it was more of the same. I re-read my review from a year ago, and my general opinions remain largely unchanged. \n\nFirst, I have a hard time believing a lot of this stuff actually came from a Nordie's. I think this for two reasons: 1.) I never see some of the brands at a Nordstrom, and 2.) They take the time to make a separate rack with a sign topper that reads \"Direct From Our Nordstrom Stores\", which infers some of this merchandise may be shipped in solely for the outlet. \n\nSecond, what little they had in terms of desirable designer duds were disappointing. They had an awkwardly-teal Prada jacket that claimed to be a men's large but looked like it could be in the junior's section of a TJ Maxx. An Armani Collezioni shirt was still approaching $300, but the sleeves were all wrong; it was like the one reject from the Armani factory hobbled its way into the Austin Rack. The Michael Kors collection shirts were OK, but their patterns were dull and uninspired. I don't think I'm going to buy any Michael Kors clothes anyway, especially after his nasty little swipes at Mondo, and his confounding decision to support Gretchen's hideous collection on Project Runway. Any accomplished designer who can say with a straight face that a collection that could have originated on the 75% off rack at a Chico's outlet somehow beats out Mondo's bold innovation and brilliant use of pattern-mixing, has compromised judgment at the least. I also used to think he was clever and catty, but this go-around he was just kind of a bitch.\n\nThe shoes: always the worst part. I don't like the brands, I don't like the styles, and I don't like the still-not-that-fabulous-of-a-deal prices. I saw one pair of Calvin Klein brown dress shoes that I approved of...but that's because I already own a similar pair.\n\nNow the designer jean section--this is the Rack's one saving grace. Like a kid in a denim candy store, I tried on Sevens, Luckys, Hugo Boss, and True Religions like there was no tomorrow. Check the clearance table for the best deals, although popular sizes are limited. I may have lost weight, but the Rack also taught me that I look utterly ridiculous in skinny hipster pants of any kind, pleather or not. I bought two pairs of Hugo Boss straight legs, and I'm hoping for the holidays to scoop up a boot cut pair of Sevens that will be marked down just a scosh more. A+ for the jeans.\n\nThis visit, I was able to interact with the staff a bit more. The woman manning the dressing room was pleasant enough, especially when I accidentally locked myself out of the room. Twice. They need to get that thing fixed. The girl ringing me up was sweet too. Poor thing. I wonder if she's ever worked a Black Friday. That's truly the end of the innocence. \n\nGenerally, my enthusiasm for this place as a whole teeters on the brink of 2 1/2-3 stars, but I'll add one more for the friendly staff...and my new, smaller jeans.", "date": "2010-11-23 20:52:40"}, {"review_id": "5nFcxztiiifpTo5NH11Uzg", "user_id": "MQxzv_wIp08Kbh1Eb3vJcA", "business_id": "0FnzifeZwmzsQgMYfT82Qw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Wanda is the BEST!

It seems like customer service is a thing of the past at other retailers - but not at Nordstrom's! \n\nAlterations Department:\nAfter scouring many stores and online sites I was having a hard time finding a wedding dress. I happened to go into Nordstrom while I was looking for a dress to wear as a guest to someone else's wedding when I found THE DRESS. As soon as I put it on I just fell in love. I had to have it, but the store did not have my size in stock. The salesperson quickly found a store with my size and had it shipped to me. While I was there I asked her about alterations because I knew that at a minimum the dress was going to have to be hemmed dramatically. The salesperson recommended the alterations department highly and boy am I glad I took her advice! \n\nMy dress was full length with a mesh, satin, and lace overlay that I knew would be very difficult to alter. When I met with the employee in the alterations department he seemed very confident that they would be able to handle all of the alterations. I had the dress hemmed, the lace bodice shortened by taking up the shoulders, and the mesh sleeves taken in. I thought matching the lace in the shoulders would be very difficult if not impossible, and thought taking in the mesh sleeves would leave a tell tale seam...yet when I picked up my dress....\n\nWOW! WOW! WOW! WOW! WOW!\n\nIt was perfect! Seriously, my mouth dropped open. I just could not believe that you could not tell the dress had been altered. It cost $70 for all of the alterations, but it was well worth it! I could not have been more pleased and I would never hesitate to take any of my most special pieces there for alterations.  A++++! \n\nOverall Store:\nSince I had such a fabulous experience with my wedding dress I have begun shopping at Nordstrom much more. I bought several dresses and had them shipped to my Maid of Honor so she could pick out her favorite for the wedding. Nordstrom's flexible return policy allowed us to return the dresses she did not like easily. \n\nI have bought other clothes, accessories, and beauty products both online and in the store. In all instances, I have received quality products, timely delivery, and excellent customer service.\n\nI am now a dedicated Nordstrom shopper!", "date": "2011-01-14 20:59:42"}, {"review_id": "m7-QEGyfkUZ8vMkU4OqbEA", "user_id": "7GPNBO496aecrjJfW6UWtg", "business_id": "0tlI9L_BOV0xs0Kae5UOpg", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a small, walk up- to go drink and food spot.

Not too thick, not too thin, topped with sea salt, pepper and fresh rosemary, served with a black olive aioli (mayo) that will have you crying for mercy and begging for more.  \n\nPrice wise, the meal was about $10.  \n\nSo why not 5 stars?

Having this place a block from my apartment is going to be real trouble for me and my credit card. \nI love Nordstrom and grew up shopping there. Since there isn't one in the city, I'm glad we have this as the next best thing. Having said that, I'm very surprised by the organizational state after only a week of being open. I understand that it's really just a step or two above Marshall's and tjmaxx. But, I kind of had this idea in my head that this being the Nordstrom representation and on Newbury Street, they might try to class it up a bit. Not the case. After only a week of being open, the place is pretty disorganized. The employees already seem tired of the job and it feels like an inconvenience to ask them for any kind of help. Ok maybe not all the employees. At check out they were very nice actually, but not so much on the floor or dressing room. They have to constantly take clothes that were just tried on or just came in and put them back where they belong...and I kind of felt like my browsing the racks was getting in the way of their doing this. I'm not really offering a solution here, but it didn't feel like the customer came first.\nI also think it could be organized a little better. The slim selection of higher end lines is in the \"dresses\" section, even if not a dress.

They were so busy that they changed the male/female dressing rooms to unisex. This wasn't that bad until a woman questioned a male as to why he was in the woman's dressing room. This man was in the dressing room with a 13 year old being inappropriate. Apparently, she was very upset. During this time I was in the dressing room. My coworker came in the dressing area to see the dress I had tried on and offered input. After about 2 minutes, he stepped out of the dressing room area.\n\nShortly after, he text me saying he was being asked to leave. I walked out of the dressing room to learn that my coworker was approached by 2 managers on duty, one being Ronald Jean.  Ronald had grabbed my coworker's shoulder in an aggressive manner and asked him to leave. Apparently, the same appalled woman from the dressing room had complained to the loss prevention manager and pointed out my coworker as the person who said the inappropriate comment about the 13 year old. \n\nNot only had Ronald handled the situation in a harassing manner, it was insulting, embarrassing, and degrading. After my coworker called Ronald's manager, Margaux Deshner, she said there was nothing she could do and offered a sarcastic apology. \n\nIs this the way customer's should be treated?  Are we not the bread and butter of their business?  Now, I understand that we don't want inappropriate comments going on in a dressing room, especially about 13 year old.  However, a customer should always be given the benefit of the doubt- NOT accused right off the bat!  \n\nThere were several issues and legalities that will be dealt with appropriately.  For one, harassment- not to mention being falsely accused and slandered.  Surely this department store has more just policies in place.

The season's hottest fashions weren't really something in my budget.  However, with my recent discovery of the Nordstrom Rack, my faith in having well-made fashionable things was discovered!\n\nThere is literally every brand name featured in a regular Nordstrom store here- and mostly for outlet prices.  So some of the prices aren't GREAT, but they're not horrible either.\n\nSo my highlights of the store are few, but worth it.  I scavenged through the clearance section and found a $5 cardigan (originally $60).\n\nI will admit, they do lack on the larger sizes unlike the south store.  They do have a decent selection of XL stuff though, if you're in an inbetweenie kind of size range.  Of course you can find a lot of straight sized stuff here, too.\n\nI also checked out their undergarments section and they do have a great, cheaper selection of shapewear and hoisery- including Spanx.  I picked up an \"originally\" $96 shapewear slip (seriously, who would pay that much to begin with?) for a ridiculous $20.  They have a lot of cute sleepwear stuff, too.\n\nThey also have things that look like they were more built for the Rack itself and have never set foot in a Nordstrom Proper.  For instance, they had a wall-o-bath-pampering items.  I picked up a much-needed bath pillow for $9- probably really the only thing I felt like I overpaid for.\n\nTheir mens section was pretty expansive as well and looked fantastic for guys in need of nice suits for a cheap suit price.\n\nThe shoes can be hit or miss, but you can expect to pay cheaper than even DSW and in some clearance cases, Payless.\n\nThis store definitely requires some digging on your part.  If you're just looking to do a quick in and out and come home with a completely new outfit, take some time.  The racks contain some hidden treasures (and also hidden disasters you can post to Facebook).\n\nThe staff is really friendly, too.  I didn't feel pestered, but I also didn't feel like they would be annoyed with me if I asked them where I could find a particular section.

Not much middle ground. \n\nThere was a nice selection of lightweight \"puffy\" down jackets in many sizes and colors, many of which were designer brands (like Michael Kors), all priced super reasonably. \n\nWe were MOST impressed with the shoe department.

The Nordstrom Rack division of Nordstrom isn't supposed to be like the full line store in any shape or form. The only similarities between the two branches are both divisions are focused on excellent customer service and bringing quality, in demand product to their stores, ( Full line and rack alike). The Boston location more or less has similar inventory to neighboring rack stores, (Burlington, Danvers) with minor variations. Keep in mind this store has only been open for 3 months, I guarantee in the NEAR future they will have a larger selection of high end merchandise and more full line transfers as well, so the customer can have a taste of the full line Nordstrom shopping experience. I have yet to see Jimmy Choo, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada or even Burberry for that matter at any Tj Maxx or Marshall's, the Rack does! 30 percent of rack merchandise is directly from the Nordstrom store the remaining 70 is specifically made and or distributed for the rack. All 3 original rack New England locations are very organized and extremely clean to this day,years after the grand openings. My closing statement is the Nordstrom Rack is not for everyone, many full line customers also are rack customers as well, others not so much. If your a Nordstrom Debit or credit card holder the same perks apply when using your card at the rack stored as well, great benefits.In my opinion the Nordstrom Rack is a wonderful store to shop at, on a weekly, monthly or even a few times a year basis. If people are so discusted and disappointed with the merchandise/store set up/shopping bag locations and or store decor  then may I suggest filling out a comment card. Nordstrom really does extremely  value feedback from their customers, so don't be shy fill one out. They are usually located at the service experience desk, so if you cannot find one ask an employee. I'm sure they would be more than happy to help you otherwise continue to shop at TJ Maxx and Marshall's. I know the Newbury Nordstrom Rack isn't going anywhere anytime soon, nor the Rack division in general. People love a bargain and there is no doubt in my mind the Nordstrom Rack is definitely a huge contender in the discounted department store venue.\n\n\n\nCheers\n\n\n\nP.

When this used to be Filene's basement or Marshalls across the street, it was hard to work through the clothing racks.\n\nHowever, they are not that organized, except for the shoe section on the second floor., with walls of shoes dedicated to men's size 7.5-17.\n\nThe inconvenience we felt were these.\n\n(combined goods for men's and women's)\nThe combined men's and women's goods - perfumes but no men's accessories on the second floor, the watches were buried with female's and many of them were out of box by rough hands and not adequate for sale.\n\n(shopping bags not found easily)\nThis simple and very important feature was not well thought disappointingly.\n\nThe shopping bags (fabric net) are hidden behind the entrance procession and nowhere to be found on the second floor. I was buying lots of little boxed items like tie clips and sunglasses, and had to carry them on the supermarket-style wheeled cart. And, the other wheeled basket was impossible to carry around as the handle gets pushed down and never stays extended. And, it was impossible to talk to the associates as they were swarmed with other customers to pay.\n\nAnd, by the time to check out, I found the black shopping bags behind the counter, and on the way out, I spotted the shopping bags hung next to the entrance. Totally odd places to put those to discourage the shoppers.\n\n(Men's clothing)\nThe clothing section is below mediocre with their tasteless outlet style basic items. More boring than Filene's on the same site before. And the price was not as good as Macy's department store for many items. And, they were not simply hip enough to make the shoppers open their wallets. The discount was at best 30%, unless the accessories at 50%.\n\n(No Men's accessories)\nAnd no bags, hats, gloves, jewelrys, purses, back pack, laptop cases or men's accessories are put together in a designated area or no where to be found. The watches were put in the first store in the middle of women's cosmetic section and cashiers didn't know the locations and could not guide me.\n\nThe sunglasses were on the second floor but did not have the sign - for men's sunglasses. And, female shoppers walk through them pointlessly. Theirs are on the first floor behind the entrance, again easily missed.\n\nOften these men's accessories are the strong sellers in the discount stores vs. fully-priced department stores.\n\n\n(other inconvenient features)\nNo sitting for husbands and the elderly. Or, simply for the tired shoppers.\n\nMen's restroom is horribly laid out, and you could be seen through the partition panels. No Privacy.\n\nAnd poor signs. visual merchandise workers should be hired. ( I don't believe such importance as a shopper, until now)\n\nSo, would I go there again? \nNo, I will find \"bargains\" in Marshall's or at Macy's for in-season items. This is neither bargain or find your jackpot designer labels. \n\nBut, we bought decent shoes at size 15 Wide, for my giant family member, his size is  hard to find in other stores with that many options in design.

So I can't try any of the clothes on yet can't return anything? That seems unethical in the least.

I've never heard anything like that in my life and the dress didn't even have a tag in that area when I purchased it. They must have a thing against returns because my boyfriend was there at the same time as me with a different cashier and they refused to return a shirt with a receipt because it was past the 45 day return policy (they also refused to exchange or give store credit) and another shirt that he didn't have a receipt for but did have the tags on it.

In general I love Nordstrom and their service is impeccable but NOT at this store.  Each time I have encountered unhelpful/borderline rude service reps.  Today for example I had selected a few items to try on and a sales gal looked right at me and walked by 2x.  Finally the third time I asked her if she could place my items in a fitting room while I continued to browse.  She did take my items but never came back to let me know where she had placed my clothes.  I did finally find another person to lead the way after I was ready to try things on. The first gal never came to check on me which was too bad since I could have used some help in getting some different sizes.  At that point I was fed up and decided to leave.  As I walked out I passed right by her and she said nothing to me at all until I let her know I would have loved some help.  Only then did she bother offering any assistance.  Frankly, I wasn't about to buy a thing there and allow her to earn any commission off me.  I went home and bought a bunch of things online.

After those 45 days are up, there is no exchange, no gift card, nothing. I learned this the hard way when I tried to return a pair of shoes I had been going back and forth over for a month and finally decided I didn't need them.\n\nSecond, there are no price adjustments. Four days ago I purchased a pair of sandals. Last night, I got an email that there was a sale, \"25% off Clearance.\" Since my sandals had been on clearance, I assumed I would be able to go back to the store and get the price adjusted. I've done this before and it is usually no big deal. Not only did the store refuse to credit me, but they couldn't even return the shoes and allow me to re-purchase them.

The shoes were still on the floor (albeit in all other sizes). \n\nNeedless to say, I will re-think every purchase from now on at Nordstrom Rack because my past few experiences have shown me that their customer service is really going downhill.

I'm going to argue, however, that it wasn't.  What she did made me much more likely to seek employees' advice in future.\n\nThere was a jacket that I was thinking about buying - I loved the color and the cut and it served exactly the purpose that I was looking for.  However, it had the problem that most clothes have for me - the medium was fitted enough but too short, and the large was long enough but too baggy.  As I was looking at the large in the mirror, I pulled it back in the back, saw how it looked, and thought, 'huh, maybe I can just get it altered.'  So up I went to the cash register and asked about their alterations.\n\nNot only did she trace with her finger every stitch they'd have to take out in order to take it in, she then asked me to put it on so she could see it on me.  Once I did, she considered me from every angle and said, 'You know, I don't think that jacket works.'\n\nWhat?  A saleslady just recommended against buying something at her store?  I am intrigued; please go on.\n\n\"It's just not shaped right for your height.  See... the sleeves should go down to here, to match up better with the bottom, which should hit you right about here.  This tie in the back?  It should hit you lower on your back to accentuate your waist.  Basically, it would take a huge amount of alteration to make this work, and it still wouldn't work as well as something that naturally fit you.'\n\nThe way she said all this was so honest (and educational - I didn't know there was a correct way for a 3/4 sleeve to hit!) that it made me want to keep shopping there, despite the fact that I was sick of shopping and had been shopping for 3 hours already.  I felt like I could ask her opinion and she'd be honest.  That if I found something I liked and that worked, her saying she liked it would actually mean something.

The lines move quickly and do not bother me. I take comfort in knowing they are doing well and will most likely be staying in Boulder. It's a win-win for all. I first went to Nordstrom Rack for the extended size women's shoes. They typically go up to a 13. That being said, the selection is very limited. I've found some athletic shoes I like. Not really finding cute flats, sandals or ankle bracelet but ya lately. Sometimes I'll go look at the selection for other sizes. If I see something I like, the app will look to see if available in larger sizes that can be ordered online. How cool is that? When I first discovered this I put a bunch of stuff in my virtual cart. When I got home to look at it, it had all disappeared. There is something written into app (at least back then) that removes things almost immediately so just to be same, I'd take photos of these items and their item #'s too just in case you need to reenter \nNow I tend to spend the majority of my time looking at clothing. I appreciate the fact that you are generally allowed to take as much stuff back to try on as you want (I'm sure there are exceptions) but it makes it so much easier. I always find reasonably priced tops and the prices on denim and pants are what is truly shocking. Almost all designer jeans that are $100 and marked down to $49.99! $49.99 is such an amazing price for the quality in these jeans. I bought a pair of Lucky jeans that remind me of my $135.

The manager, Cody W., walked over and immediately asked, \"where did you buy these boots\". I told him I purchased them here at this store, and he said \"No you didn't. We never sold these here\". I told that I definitely purchased them here, as I was having lunch with a coworker at this location on the day I bought them. He wouldn't believe me and kept saying \"No you didn't buy them here. There's no way you bought them here. I'm the assistant manager, I would know\".

I asked him if he could see the which location I purchased the boots, and he said, \"okay they were purchased here\". He did not even offer an apology once.

After my experience with the jewelry department I am seriously considering cancelling my card as the customer service in the jewelry department is severely lacking. I received a pair of Lana gold earrings for Mother's Day. They were beautiful and I looked forward to wearing them. I noticed one of the backings was bent which made the back not very secure. Upon opening of our store I went in to talk to someone in the jewelry department. I told them what had happened and asked if they could order me a new back. I was asked if I had worn them and told if I had they were not returnable. I never said I wanted to return them I just wanted a new backing. These earrings were shipped from the domain store by the way so quality control is an issue if they didn't check them completely before shipping them to my husband. I was not told anything like I'm sorry this happened to you, let's see what we can do to fix the situation. I was told Lana was shut down for up to 6 to 8 weeks and after they opened they could mail the tiny backing back to get it replaced.  I was then told if they had the same pair they could exchange them. Of course they did not. I found it odd that I would have to wait a few months to wear the earrings over a tiny backing. When I got home I contacted Lana jewelry myself and told them the situation. They informed me that their repair department was closed until June 1 but this was not considered a repair it was a defect. Kacey from Lana immediately put in a request to send me a complete pair of matching backs no charge which will be here in a few days. So thanks jewelry department for your no customer service. You didn't even try to call Lana for me you were to focused on asking me if I had worn them and telling me if I had that they were non returnable. I have had other incidences of the poor customer service from this Nordstrom location in the past but this one just finally prompted me to write a review. I do not like to write negative reviews as I feel it's best to go to the source first. I am hoping someone in upper management will read this and take it as constructive criticism however I do not feel confident this will happen due to past experiences.

This place is SUPER popular and extremely crowded. You can't really look for clothes because the racks are confusing as are the sizes. They have the racks too close together so you can't really walk through there. The purses are fun to check out but you can never find an associate nearby to unlock them so you can \"try one on\" for size or even look inside. Most of them are \"chained\" together. I get the need to do this for security, but isn't that what the metal detectors are for? Why is it only Michael Kors stuff that in linked together? The shoes.....For someone with a larger foot, now that Payless is out of business...this is the place to go. You can get designer shoes much cheaper but the best part is how large their selection is for sizes 10-13 for women! That's so hard to find!!! Even Payless couldn't compete with that! The downside is the area is a pig's pen...there's shoes all over the floor thanks to lazy consumers who don't bother putting things back where they belong, but also thanks to the employees that are never anywhere to be found when you need help. No one is cleaning things up and you definitely cannot roll a cart through the shoe area so don't even bother trying. They never have enough registers open and there have been times where I was in there and had one thing to purchase, but put it back because the line to checkout was way too long. The one time I've purchased from there, I stood in line to checkout for 20 minutes. There were only 2 registers open and it was a Saturday afternoon.

Plus, when doing Christmas shopping, gift wrapping is free. That's amazing! I don't have to wrap a thing and cry that it looks terrible. Bazille, their 2nd floor restaurant, is also an amazing place to grab noms and sips for convenience without leaving the store, and their front cafe is light and airy. \n\nThank you Nordstrom for my Northside comforts.

I walked up to the Laura Mercier and NARS counter and was promptly greeted by a nice, young man.  I told him what I needed and what shade of tinted moisturizer I was using and turns out, it was too dark for my complexion.  He got me straightened out with the right shade and it looks great.

Secondly, being strangers, their intentions can never be genuine worry about your unhappiness. Thirdly, since when has demanding an unhappy person to smile ever made them suddenly stop being unhappy? So I must question -- why? And why do men, specifically, feel they have the right to tell women to smile. Why do they expect women to do what they want them to, just because they said so. The smile benefits them, they can see it, not us. It's not for our benefit -- so it must be for theirs.\"\n\nSo it is safe to say that I will not be visiting this Nordstrom Rack location again.

Since Nordstrom's closed the Lloyd Center store, I've had to shop online which is no problem given you get free shipping and free returns.  So if something doesn't fit, it goes back with no effort at all.  But being vertically challenged, when I do get something I love, it almost always needs altered.  BUT, low and behold, if you have a Nordstrom credit card, you will get, at the very least, up to $100.00 of free alterations per year.  (You receive a Nordstrom note equal to the amount of your alteration).  So what's to lose?  \n  I just bought a beautiful pink suit on line and of course the pants needed shortened... no surprise there.  But the jacket sleeves also needed shortened and so I went to Clackamas for alterations.  First, the tailor has been with Nordstrom for over 18 years (she used to be at Lloyd) so you know she has some serious seamstress chops.  She asked me all about where I wanted the sleeves to fall and explained that I might be sacrificing some of the decorative buttons.  She made sure I understood everything and the charge was really small compared to what I thought it would be.\nSo I picked up my suit this last weekend and it was PERFECT.  It was as though it had been made for me from the get go.  Absolutely impressive and amazing.   She kept all the decorative buttons on the sleeves and the suit is simply gorgeous.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Just one word of caution --- don't be in a rush when you are dropping off.  It is better to take your time and talk to the tailor than to rush through.  It may take a little while and some patience, but it is definitely worth it!

At first you may not get what the fuss is all about, but after shopping there a few times, believe me, you will get it.  \n\nHere are few things that set Nordstrom apart from other stores:\n\n1.)  The customer service is some of the best out there.  The sales associates are knowledgeable, friendly, and make you feel like you are important to them, no matter how small your purchase.  I don't know where they find these people, but I've never had a bad experience with a Nordstrom SA.\n\n2.) The return policy is the most flexible return policy on this planet.   No time limits on returns and no questions asked.   I once returned a pair of shoes that I had worn several times.  It became apparent to me after wearing the shoes that they weren't comfortable and they were never going to become \"broken in\".  Brought them back and my account was credited, no questions asked.   Good policy on their part because I spent a lot of money that day in their store.\n\n3.)  They have amazing sales, the best of which is their annual anniversary sale in July.  This is not your typical end of season clearance type of sale.  They bring in all new merchandise and offer the new styles at sale prices.  I look forward to this sale all year.  \n\n4.)  If they don't have something in your size, they will find it for you at another store and ship it to you for free, as long as the item is over $25.   \n\n5.)  They will do price matching.   Yep, you heard me right.  A high end department store that does price matching.  This is awesome because I often find items online for a lower price, but I would much prefer to buy from Nordstrom where I can get treated like a VIP, and have the comfort of knowing that if something doesn't work out I can return it very easily.\n\nSo give it a try and before long you too will be wondering why you ever shopped anywhere else.", "date": "2009-11-09 02:48:31"}, {"review_id": "7540lGc29ok-XBJ8EaHUag", "user_id": "XO-IW-8xk6Tz8JEUtSkSug", "business_id": "JarPA4IR-RKEEU0TJkivUg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I was visiting Portland and decided to do some shopping.

The prices were still rather high for what they were selling. The best deal I found was a Ralph Lauren blazer for ~$250, which is good for that item, but the truth is it's not a very high quality jacket. They also had Hart Shaffner Marx.\n\nThe shirts all had two sleeve sizes (32/33, 34/35) which is a tell-tale sign of a mediocre quality dress shirt. I wouldn't want to pay more than $30 for such a shirt, but they were selling for $50-$60 which is just too much. Tie bars still ridiculously priced at $30 when you can order them online for a couple of bucks.\n\nThere were a few nice items, but overall it wasn't was I was expecting with the Nordstrom name being on the sign. If they had had more Nordstrom brand dress shirts, which come in single-size sleeves are a well-known high-value dress shirt, I might have added a star.\n\nAs it is, there is nothing \"wrong\" with this store, but kind of like Stein Mart and Kohl's, I'm not sure why I'd want to shop here for clothes. The prices are too high to make this a true \"discount\" store and the clothing quality is generally too low to make it a high-end bargain. The way I look at it, if I need an item that is just basic and functional, I will \"try\" to find it at JC Penney, TJMaxx, ROSS, Old Navy, or Burlington Coat Factory.

So while sales associates are supposed to be selling, to make their draw (minimum sales quota) each pay period, they instead have to help you to get your return processed.  You get cash and help them to get one step closer to being fired.  And processing your returns not only counts against them, but keeps them from helping other shoppers on the sales floor.  This is not an employee friendly corporation.\n\nShoppers love this company for its generous return policy; they will take anything back, worn or not, and give you cash!  So next time you get a new dress for your cousin's wedding, wear it and then return it (pretty good system for shoppers who have the cash to lay out for the original purchase, or are quick enough to steal a gift card, eh?) remember that you are helping to get the sales associate, who so graciously helped you, lose their job.", "date": "2015-02-11 22:43:20"}, {"review_id": "IGr7RvLuWMVj2SrK5zAQ-w", "user_id": "FdPioXvctMq8lhBtd_NnTg", "business_id": "yMvwor96CN06jfSc8n_jHg", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 14, "funny": 9, "cool": 14, "text": "Not sure why the low rating but I always leave a happy customer when I come here.

The dress was a grey, beautiful, Monique Lhuillier cocktail piece (retailed at $200+) but got at NR for less than $100, I mean, wow what a deal already.\n\nAfter finding the perfect bridesmaid dress, my bestie and I had to get more of the same dress in different sizes, for all the other bridesmaid in her bridal party.

Rax in San Leandro, CA and they looked up the UPC and gave me a bunch of numbers of stores that could possibly have the dress in the store. \n\nI called the Nord. Rax in Orlando, FL and Randy, the sales associate, who was kind enough and definitely patient enough to search and FIND the exact dress and the desired dress I've been looking for in the past weeks.

That being said, some of the recent changes to the Nordstrom Rack customer service polices are, in my opinion, un-Nordstrom-like. Nordstrom has generally been known for its stellar customer service. Well, not anymore. Now, at Nordstrom Rack there is a hard cut off policy for returns. \n\nFirst, there are now no returns after 45 days (even with tags on and receipt in hand!). After those 45 days are up, there is no exchange, no gift card, nothing. I learned this the hard way when I tried to return a pair of shoes I had been going back and forth over for a month and finally decided I didn't need them.\n\nSecond, there are no price adjustments. Four days ago I purchased a pair of sandals. Last night, I got an email that there was a sale, \"25% off Clearance.\" Since my sandals had been on clearance, I assumed I would be able to go back to the store and get the price adjusted. I've done this before and it is usually no big deal. Not only did the store refuse to credit me, but they couldn't even return the shoes and allow me to re-purchase them. I completely understand if it had been a month since I had purchased, but it had only been 4 days! The shoes were still on the floor (albeit in all other sizes). \n\nNeedless to say, I will re-think every purchase from now on at Nordstrom Rack because my past few experiences have shown me that their customer service is really going downhill.

He tried on his usual size, and while the jacket fit well, he was unable to close the pants. We met with their in-house tailor, who assured us that he would be able to let the pants out enough for them to fit perfectly. We ordered the suit so he'd have a brand new one and received it three days later. We brought it back to the tailoring department at Nordstrom, where a different tailor told us the suit was too small and that we would need to order a size up. At this point we were about three and a half weeks out from our wedding, and were a little concerned about getting the larger size tailored in time. A sales associate had the next size up shipped overnight and we were told that the additional alterations would take 3 weeks. Once the larger suit came in, we went back yet again to have it fitted, and were given a pickup date of three days before we were headed to New York for our wedding. When we picked up the suit, something about it looked off. We asked the sales associate who had originally helped us if he thought the fit was correct, and he assured us that it was perfect. Still skeptical, we brought it home so that he could try it on with the rest of his outfit for the wedding. This was when we realized that something was terribly wrong. Not only did they seem to have not taken the jacket in at all, they had added in ONE large shoulder pad. Just one. The pants also did not seem to have been altered at all aside from the length and were completely baggy. In a panic, I called the tailor who had worked on my wedding dress (shout out to Red Carpet Alterations!) to see if we could come in for a rush job. When we arrived, they were horrified by the botched job Nordstrom's tailoring department had done. The tailor ripped out the enormous single shoulder pad on the spot, which immediately improved the overall look, and told us that he would be able to fix the remainder of Nordstrom's atrocious alterations in three days. With mere hours to spare before our flight, we picked up the suit and luckily the new alterations were perfect. Nordstrom not only caused massive amounts of unnecessary pre-wedding stress, we also had to spend a large amount of money to have their mistakes fixed. The single shoulder pad was so unnecessary and bizarre, we kept comparing the tailoring job to a botched surgery. Nordstrom claims that, \"since 1901, we've been committed to providing our customers with the best possible service - and to improving it every day.\" I sincerely hope that they live up to this claim and ensure that their tailors actually know what they are doing.

She asked if I was ready I said yes. She then asked if I wanted my receipt printed or emailed. I really hope this is not the new normal as it seems to be.

I can't comment on the price, as everything was MSRP, but the tailoring service was fantastic both times (cost $22 to keep the original hem - which is slightly below average, in my experience).\n\nThe selection is decent - lots of True Religion (my personal favorite), Diesel, Rock & Republic, and Rock Revival. Too much Rock Revival, in my opinion. No Nudie jeans and they haven't had any Seven A-Pockets for guys in store (they have them online, though).

Thankfully I had somewhere to go so I was limited on how much time I had to kill. \n\nFirst off, this is not a Ross so 9 times out of 10 you are not going to find a 9.99 purse. These high end brands are marked down drastically from what they would cost if they were regular price. So the \"discount\" price here could be considered expensive for someone who is used to Ross and Marshalls prices. I'm not being a snob but just trying to break it down for those who are disappointed with pricing.  \n\nIt has been awhile since I had been here and my review is mainly targeted towards the womens shoe section.  I did speed browse through the clearance sections of women's jewelry and handbags but devoted my precious time to shoes.   Now that area is a big maze. I didn't know where the clearance shoe racks began and ended. I eventually found my sizes and I will say that there is a good selection of shoes of all brands(yes high/middle end but some fairly affordable). And everything is neatly organized and sized appropriately. If you are browsing boxes based on brands, STOP what you're doing. I discovered that many pairs of shoes were in mismatched boxes. For instance, I found an adorable pair of Cole Haan's that I picked out based on the shoes itself but they were in a random box of a different brand. I wouldn't have found them if I was browsing based on what the box said.   There was also a nice selection of women's sneakers so definitely worth checking out as well. \n\nI didn't really browse through the clothing as I am more of an accessories person. It wasn't too packed when I went (weekday) so if I was to shop the racks , that would be the time to go.  Also noticed makeup and haircare but no time to browse.\n\nThere isn't really much in terms of customer service here probably since it's more of an \"outlet\" store. There were several security tags on merchandise so that's probably one of the main reasons you would have to seek someone out. \n\nCheckout was quick.

But the staff in the shoe dept was really, really nice and helpful. I asked why they didn't carry those other brands - they said they were trying to get some in their store and had multiple requests for those brands. So there's hope yet!  They did have Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Cole Haan, and Stuart Weitzman which often have some cute stuff. I got a cute pair of Michael Kors heels and I am loving them. \n\nThe woman at the makeup counter was helpful and knew about the Mario Badescu line which was nice. She even sent me a handwritten thank you card after I bought some stuff from her - always a nice touch. Those kinds of things always make me want to go back to that person to buy from. \n\nHandbags are ok. The Natick store just has such a larger handbag section and more high-end bags. There were certainly some cute bags, but overall I'd rather shop for a handbag at the Natick store. Maybe as they figure out their market this dept. will get better?\n\nWomen's clothes - ok. Good selection of jeans, cute tops, and nice dress pants - got a pair of nice summer pants yesterday. But I find mostly they only have one or two racks of each designer - with the exception of Burberry (good selection of Burberry) and St John. \n\nMen's dept seemed about the same as the one in Natick. Bought bf some clothes for his birthday yesterday. \n\nWhat drags this store down from a possible 4 stars to a 3 is the completely annoying saleswoman/stalker in the men's dept!! I was walking through picking up some items for bf. A guy comes over and asks if he can hold them at the register for me. Sure. That's nice, I like not having to carry it all around with me. Then he tells me his name (which I now forget) and says let me know if you have any questions. Perfect thanks. All was going well.\n\nNext thing I know this other lady comes out of nowhere all up in my grill. She's like oh these are nice, did you see these other pants by blah blah blah, and stalked me through out the entire men's dept! I did my best - I'm all set, if I have any questions I will let you know. Besides I was already kind of dealing with the guy that was holding my stuff and he had already been helpful with some questions I had. She would NOT go away. It was really annoying. It fact the more I think about it I think it could negatively impact Nordstrom if salespeople act like that. It made me want to go back to the Natick one, rather than go to Burlington. I mean the Natick one has a much better shoe dept. already and the salespeople there seem much less pushy. Anyway, she continued to stalk my friend and I and offer unsolicited advice as I said things like I'm all set or just ignored her.\n\nFinally I've figured out what I want to get for bf and go back up to the counter where the guy is and pick up the other clothes I already put on his counter to look at everything and check out. He's about to ring me in - when that freaking lady comes back over and basically tries to push him aside and says 'oh she's all set I'm handling this customer'. UM no don't f*****  think so lady. In case you don't remember you didn't help me with anything and just stalked me for a half hour offering random advice I ignored... He's like 'no actually I was helping her, and I've been holding these clothes at the register for her'. She was like oh I see all annoyed and walked away. Couldn't she see/hear that he picked up clothes on the register and handed them back to me and asked if I wanted everything I had held up there? Did she think I randomly was buying stuff left on the register from someone else? I thought that was so scummy to try to steal this guy's commission (if they do in fact work on commission). And had he not said something I would have said no this nice man (who didn't harass me) was helping me. \n\nI mean maybe she's hard up for commission, but perhaps not stalking people while they are shopping would be beneficial to her - maybe people would be inclined to buy from her if they didn't feel harassed. It felt like when you are on vacation walking by those cheap t-shirt shops and the help totally and constantly harass you - like oh you totally need this shitty $5 t-shirt - it's a must with your wardrobe and the price is right.

Because this is a larger store than the downtown location, which is close to where I live, I drove out to Clakamas specifically because I was seeking more inventory. I had already been downtown and selection was sparse; the Clackamas store was no better. \n\nWas actually shocked that the accessories department was quite bare. Other than a decent selection of sunglasses, the jewelry, scarves, and handbag departments were practically non existent. I'm an accessories gal and there was nothing for me to even consider. \n\nWhile there I exchanged a maroon cashmere scarf that I had received for Christmas. The color just doesn't work for me and I was hoping to find other options. There were none! I get that it's after Christmas but it's mid January, seriously, no scarves? The woman working behind the counter was super helpful and offered to find one online. There was one deep blue scarf available at the Washington Square store. It was the same style so it would be an even exchange as I didn't have a gift receipt.  Debra went above and beyond, even calling the store to verify it was still there on the floor, asking the rep to find and pull the one remaining scarf so that when she placed the order, it could be fulfilled. It's being shipped and I will have it Monday. Yay! Thank you, Debra.\n\nAfterwards I went upstairs and walked through the clothing department. Lots of wide aisles, open spaces making it easy to see and find items, yet nothing really impressed me, even on the multitude of Reduced racks. Maybe it was a timing thing as they just finished their half yearly sale and maybe haven't restocked. \n\nOne point of advice, Nordstrom's, put all of your sizes together. Why should women seeking an article of clothing in size 14 or above need to go to one tiny section of the store? We are all women, just put the slacks and sweaters in one area and extend the rack so they go from size 0-24. \n\nNewsflash, some women wear a size 10 or 12 top and a size 14 pants. Yep, that's an actual possibility! So for people like me, I have to shop for a sweater or blouse in one part of the store, then walk to a different department to find pants. Ridiculous.

They started leaking and I tried to take them in FOR REPAIR.

In fact, but for my underwear everything that I was wearing was from Nordstrom! My point is a fershure verified customer.\n\nDuring the last 1/2 yearly sale I got a BIG box addressed to me however I hadn't shopped the sale yet. I figured my daughter made the purchase. She didn't. I opened the box to find multiple dresses a nice leather carryall, aa pair of Cole Haans etc. Also inside was an order form showing who the items should have been delivered to. Oops! I called the store to notify them and after looking the order number up the rep said, \"that's not ours, call the rack\"! Say what? Not thanks for notifying us nuttin. I called the Rack and was told to bring the items in. I said, \"no. The box is big and the reason I shop online is to avoid coming in the store\". The broad sat there on the line for a nice pregnant pause and said, \"it would really help us out if you could bring the box in or have someone else bring it\". WTF! Send me return shipping and have UPS come and get this box out of my dining room! THEN! UPS showed up two days in a row to get the box without my telling them it was ready. Nordstrom never uttered a single, \"thanks\".\n\nIcing the cake was the black teenagers who walked out of the store with the police waiting for them with the store having called assuming they were stealing.

Long story short the gal that had been assisting me walked over to have it somebody else do it because I guess it takes two people to do one job there and there was a miscommunication between them. The other person thought that she was supposed to be getting the full product for me to purchase and then was confused when I said no no I don't have money with me to pay for that I only need a sample. The girl then full-on corrected me in front of everyone saying \"all that you needed to tell her was that you needed a sample that's it\".

I told her what I was looking for and she said she can look it up in the computer to see what she has but showed me a few things first, none of which were appropriate for what I was looking for or the right size, she again said she can look it up but never did, then politely excused herself to help other customers.

This store seemed to have more selection than Winter Park.  For many women, finding \"label\" shoes at a discount is like striking gold.  I struck gold a couple of times in this store.  So, YAY shoe area!\n\nAs for the rest of the store, it didn't seem as nice or organized as the Winter Park location.  I can't explain it but is also felt \"cheaper\" and maybe that is just the set up and aesthetics of the store ... and yes, I know the point of the store is \"cheaper\", it just didn't feel as nice as the other one.  I also didn't see as many \"must have\" bags or ladies apparel.  I realize that stores have different items available at different times so I'm totally willing to note that maybe I hit it during an \"off\" week/month.\n\nHere's where my experience really turned sour ... the check out line.  The lady who checked me out seemed to be \"over it\" this particular day.  She was \"over me\" when I declined opening a Nordstrom card.  She barely looked me in the eye when she spoke to me and seemed to be moving a bit slow.  I get it ... retail ... its not the most glamorous gig so I was just wanting to pay and leave, so I did.  However, when leaving, the alarm went off and I stopped and turned around to look at the cashiers who didn't even look up.  There was no concern from anyone at that counters so I continued outside as I had heard the alarm go off a couple of times while shopping.  I reasoned that it was a faulty alarm and headed out.  As I was leaving, a lady whose shirt said Loss Prevention, rushed up to me outside and asked me to step inside to make sure all the sensors were off of the clothes.  To me, this was a nice way of saying, \"let me check to make sure you paid for everything.\"  After checking all my purchases, there was a sensor still attached to one of the items and the cashier who checked me out mumbled something like \"oh well.\"  Well, its not just an \"oh well\" for me ... it was more like, \"oh, this is embarrassing as they think I stole goods.\"  Not only was it embarrassing but it took up my time when I was trying to get going.\n\nSo, there ya go.

I ended up going to another store. \n\nAnother time I went to the lingerie department during the Semi Annual Sale. I get that they are busy but they didn't really help me at all or give me an estimate of when someone would be free.\n\nI wish Nordstrom offered more plus sizes. This isn't the first time I have had this issue of my size not being there. At the semi annual sale this year there was a serious lack of options compared to previous years. When I pointed this out to an associate she said that people must have bought all the sizes. She was straight sized and based on her comment I don't think she understood the frustration and difficulty plus sized women have due to the lack of options they have compared to other women. Straight sized clothing gets the better  part of an entire floor while plus clothes are relegated to a tiny corner. I have made comments to this affect but based on my experience yesterday little seems to have changed.\n\nAlso, I have developmental coordination disorder and found the line at customer service difficult to navigate. It's not clear  where the line begins or ends. When I gave feedback on this and asked about it the answer wasn't helpful at all -- something like \"it depends\".\n\nI like their brands, the rewards program the cafe and the variety of price points. Also when I had an issue with my trunk club purchase someone in operations was really helpful.  I think the shopping experience for plus sized and neurodiverse people could be a lot better and they could do better with taking feedback and putting themselves in my shoes.", "date": "2020-02-12 02:37:32"}, {"review_id": "e08j2iNQQZ9wlvfAlhP1BA", "user_id": "rIiyFBcS5hQSORL7xeWNrg", "business_id": "1G7oMiwrXiAIIUK04Z-K6Q", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 9, "funny": 5, "cool": 8, "text": "I'm here everyday !

Let me tell you, I do. Their sizes are large in the bust and small in the cup, and I haven't been in that size range since middle school. They don't have anything near my size in that store.\n\nLook, I'm no freak (I swear!), but there is a wider world of bra sizes. You've heard of Intimacy in Copley? Well, I think Nordstrom is actually better. They have the bra fitters (in fact, I'm looking at the business card of the woman who helped me and it says fit and prosthesis certified, whoa), and the price ranges are lower, from my experience.\n\nWhen I go in I walk right past those adorable little lacey things that I'll never wear. Don't even look. Yesterday Patricia Vann was my fitter, and I just told her my size and she set me up with a dressing room and brought all the bras in. No hassle, no drama, minimal disapointment. And, unlike Victoria's Secret, where I get raised eyebrows when I'll tell them my size, Patricia was very understanding. We had a dialogue, and she found me just what I needed.\n\nOverall, a great experience.
