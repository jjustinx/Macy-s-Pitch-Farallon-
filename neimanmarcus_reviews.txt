But I guess it just didn't turn out that way... I sort of resisted reviewing Neiman's Natick location since I had already reviewed their Copley location, but after my shopping experience this week I really had to give them a great review. Lame maybe, but they really deserve some great praise for this experience.  \n\nSure there are a few things that annoy me about Neiman's - one is they close at 8pm every night. That's annoying for me - because often I don't get out of work until 7 or 8pm, but it's probably pretty nice for their employees that they don't get stuck there till 11pm every night. The other is that they only accept Neiman's CC (which I have) and AMEX - no visa or mastercard. What store doesn't accept those??? \n\nI went in after work for their First Mark sale  - where everything in the store is on sale for one day only. Even brand new stuff. 40% off! How can you beat that??? Then I guess after that day the new merchandise goes back to normal price, and the sale items get marked down 25-50% in their First Call sale. \n\nI wondered how it would be. Would they really have new stuff on sale, or is it typical bait and switch stores like to do? It wasn't. There were great new clothes and shoes on sale. Basically the whole store was on sale. Which is fantastic to get some summer staples (t-shirts, light-weight dress pants for work, fun tanks, and short sleeve dress shirts). \n\nShortly after starting to pick some items off the shelf to try on a woman came over and asked if I wanted to start a fitting room. I did. She came back over every once in a while when I had more clothes in my hands to add them to the dressing room. Maybe she has to do that as part of her job - but I appreciate not having to carry around 20 different shirts/pants. When I was ready to try stuff on she lead me to my dressing room and came back every 15 minutes or so (enough that it wasn't pushy or ignoring me) to see how I was doing. \n\nI sent a bunch of stuff back, I asked for a lot more sizes... She took the items I didn't want, and looked to find the other items in my size. She had to have come back at least 4 or 5 times with various sizes etc. Two items she couldn't find and offered to have them shipped from another store and the other she looked for a while and finally found the size I needed. \n\nI really appreciated the effort she put into it. I hate when I go into stores and they treat you like they could care less if you give them your business. Like you are lucky they let you shop there and give them money. She wasn't like that AT ALL.  And as if I hadn't already had her looking for all kinds of sizes - I asked her to ring in each item and tell me the sale price so I could decide if it was really worth the sale price. A took several items, and a few I decided it just wasn't worth it. She was so nice through the whole thing. Never acted like I was putting her out to do such a thing - totally friendly and professional. \n\nIt really was a GREAT shopping experience. Good enough I will go back to the Natick Neiman's location before I go back to Copley's. \n\nI wish my 100th review was more exciting with lots of drama, but I felt compelled to let people know how great the service was at Neiman's Natick.", "date": "2008-05-10 03:36:56"}, {"review_id": "L1ZFGj6cXC-hk-yu9-8OmQ", "user_id": "szNRP1PnxbNxnS1v9wen8Q", "business_id": "557LMlEbbJ8JolfP-lXj1w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "This place is always so welcoming!

Way to go, Natick!  So, if you're not a fan of the Copley location or getting in and out of Boston is a pain in the ass, this is the Neimans for you.\n\nPersonally, I shop here for cosmetics, shoes, and jewelry and I've always had great service.  I have a Neimans card which makes shopping a little easier since my cosmetics purchases are \"tracked\" and can be referenced.  For instance, I bought a few bracelets at Neimans and after a few days of wearing them, I just wasn't all that into them like I was.  I exchanged them with no problem and no hassle.  \n\nTony in the shoe section is very knowledgeable and polite.  Whether I'm looking for something \"normal\" to wear to work (i.e. my Tory Burch flats) or something fun, he's my go-to guy for suggestions.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the selection is a little sparse as compared to other locations.\n\nNeimans also recently opened a cafe in this particular location to rival Nordstrom.

The trick is for places like this is to get to know the sales person and get into their client book, so they can let you know when things go on sale.  Some of the really high end stuff does go on sale, but they do it very quietly.  A family member of mine was shopping there for a Chanel Bag.

I will be the first to admit, I make piddle for money. I think paying a large amount of money for something just because it has a 'special' name on it is absurd. And I live with adult roomates... who raised me. And the career path I chose does not have a lot of money behind it. \n\nWith that being said, I went into NM with a friend who has the money... or plastic to shop here. I had been looking for 4 years for a replacement for my perfume that got discontinued. I went to every store, every perfume shop and smelled every scent to the point of headaches. I was scentless for years. While my friend was being attended to for his skin care needs I decided to smell a pretty bottle. And of course, I loved it, all $150 dollars of it. I asked the girl behind the counter some questions like, 'what size bottles do they come in?, What are the prices?' When I heard the price I was in a bit of shock, (My last favorite perfume was $40 and that was a bit much for my wallet.) I really loved it tho. I asked if she had a sample so that I might be convinced to put some money aside for it a little later. When she heard me say I am not buying it today, she rolled her eyes, scoffed and turned around and walked away. Not a word was said by her. This confirmed my distaste for expensive shops and the snobby people who go there. That was in December of 2010. \n\nI went back with the same friend. Went back up to the same counter and smelled the same perfume. I still loved it. The very friendly woman behind the counter talked to me, actually TO me, not at me. She was sympathetic, in that fact that this is a big $$ decision for me (maybe not for everyone else who shops there, but certainly for me) and I should be sure that I wanted this before I put the money down on it. But she also made me realize that if I am going to treat myself, it might as well be this, because it would be my scent, a part of me. She then gave me a sample. I walked around the mall thinking and thinking. I then turned right around and bought the perfume. The small bottle first, and the big bottle on my next shopping trip. My sales clerk was Anna. About 5'2\" with blonde hair. I will only buy from her. If I walk in and she is not working that day, I will come back when she is on again.\n\nI gave 3 stars because it the luck of the draw when it comes to sales people.

And that mission was shoes. (Granted, it's often my mission, I even have a blog about shoes.) \n\nI was not my finest. It is THE MALL. So I shunned my Feragamos for some comfy Rockports (if you want to wear those stilettos you love so much in old age, you don't want to wear them ALL THE TIME. Your feet with thank me) and did a little couture-a-thon. \n\nI love the Natick Collection, on whole, because you can visit all of these high end shops and departments stores without looking and acting like a snob and still receive genuine, warm customer service. Except, apparently, at Neiman Marcus. \n\nThe \"gentleman\" in the shoe department did not acknowledge my presence, despite the fact that I was lingering and checking out shoes for a while. I didn't expect attention right away, as he was catering to another woman when I walked over, but when another woman appeared some time after me, in a perfectly pressed shirt and Tory Burch flats he IMMEDIATELY flitted over to her and asked if she needed any help, abandoning the first woman. Um.  HELLO.  I'm right here.   It was a very \"Pretty Woman\" moment. I looked over to him and the look he shot back at me felt like disdain. \n\nThis, of course, was hysterical. I really hope this guy makes commission, because I spend more on shoes than some people spend on cars and houses.  I headed over to men's where my shopping companion was having a much friendlier experience and told him the story. \n\nFor shame, Neiman Marcus, for shame. \n\nAdditionally, the selection was very sparse.   Only a few pair from any given designer, and, in many cases, not the most recent offerings from that designer.  Did I mention my obsession with shoes yet?\n\nAnyway, I won't be back.   Ever.\n\n\nPS \nDear Shoe Guy: You sell shoes. Get off your high horse. Also, you are WAY too old for that hair.\n\n(In other news, I CLEANED UP at Nordstrom.)", "date": "2011-07-18 14:54:00"}, {"review_id": "XA_psf_PjfNwbS9stgiOFg", "user_id": "FtZwCY_jZvWh5l-skWuafQ", "business_id": "557LMlEbbJ8JolfP-lXj1w", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Neiman Marcus at the Natick Mall is a exceptional location.

I was at the Natick MA store to check out the Trillium Canada Goose parka. I had been researching online to buy a CG parka and had narrowed it  down to either a Trillium or a Kensington. I was at the store to try both the parkas and then come to a decision. The lady at the counter was very friendly but kept insisting on me purchasing the trillium over the Kensington. I wanted to try a medium in both but she only had the large in the Kensington which I was floating in.So she made me try a Trillium in medium and although I thought it was a bit too snug for me but she threw her marketing pitch to me about how well it fit me. She suggested that it's better if it's snug to prevent cold air drafts. I ended up buying the Trillium. She squeezed the jacket in a paper Neiman Marcus bag and handed it over to me. \nThree days later I wore the parka to a family dinner and didn't feel comfortable at all. I had trouble sitting in the car with my jacket on. So after I got home, I checked the size of the jacket just because I was a little concerned that a medium was also getting snug on me and to my horror and utter dismay I discovered that I was given a Small Petite ( I am 5'6\") by the sales woman. On one hand I was relieved to know that it wasn't the size I had outgrown but  on the other I was outraged at the unprofessional behavior of the sales woman at an elite store like Neiman Marcus. I trusted her and she broke my trust by selling me the wrong size. Not sure if they work on commissions. \nI had to drive back 50 minutes to return the jacket the next day. I did voice my disconcern at the customer service but all I was told politely was that if I had called the store would have arranged to pick up the item from my house and saved me a trip. \nI ended up buying my Canada Goose jacket from CG online .

After being a Nordstrom customer for many years, I was extremely unimpressed. Walking through the downstairs departments I couldn't help but be struck by just how many more salespeople than customers there were. Conservatively, I would estimate that there were three times as many employees (many of which were texting and gossiping with one another) as there were actual shoppers. \n\nA quick pass through the downstairs area, and I found the men's department and began browsing to seeing what all they had. Now here's where the disappointment comes in; I wasn't approached, greeted, or assisted by anyone. As I was looking at several suits one employee even walked right by me and gave me a very condescending stare and fake smile. You know, the one that says \"LOL you can't even afford to pay attention in here.\" This lack of service was undoubtedly due to my appearance as I'm generally in jeans, t-shirt, and Sperry's when not in the office. The irony is that these \"salespeople\" often equate outward physical appearance (shiny shoes, ties, brand names, etc) with high net worth. This generalization could not be further from the truth as many professional men and women I know simply want to be comfortable when not at work. \n\nSo here's where it gets really good. After looking through their limited selection of business and sportswear, I found their even more limited shoe department. It took me a few seconds but I located the shoe that I had seen online and picked it up and began looking at it. I even walked over to a mirror, tried it on and looked at how it looked on my feet. Still nothing. Two salesman were standing at a counter nearby looking at several sheets of paper and engaged in a very intense discussion. One of them very tepidly offered \"hello there\" to which I replied my normally cordial \"hello\" with a smile. Every one who knows me knows that I'm constantly smiling and very friendly to everyone I meet. My mom used to always tell me that I never met a stranger. However, after more time passed and I was literally looking at other shoes holding the shoe I wanted to buy in my hand, my congeniality was on it's last leg. I walked directly up to the counter and asked if I could try the shoe on in my size. They exchanged looks and then the senior of the two summoned a young lady who was walking by to grab the shoe from the back. She also gave them a glance and with a slight sigh was off to help. Upon returning she informed me that she didn't have it in my size, but brought one that was a full size too small. She also brought another pair of completely different brand and style of shoes that were at a much more affordable price point. She then sarcastically asked \"so you have a big interview coming up?\" Wrong. Don't assume, we all know what happens when we assume. This was followed up with \"Yeah, these are a bit pricey but since you probably just need a basic dress shoe I brought these for you to look at.\" Wrong. Don't presume to know what someone can or cannot afford. Since they didn't have the shoe (which I did love despite their efforts to the contrary) in my size, she kept trying to pressure me to order it. I politely declined and politely walked out of there quickly. \n\nThe conclusion is that this place is filled with lazy, entitled \"salespeople\" who won't deign to approach you unless you physically display some semblance of wealth.

Her mostly black and grey attire and long-sleeved shirts simply weren't cutting it.  She needed sundresses.  She needed shorts.  She needed blouses, but most of all she needed color!\n\nWe started by looking at the racks on our own.  Don't do that.  After 15 minutes of getting nowhere, I asked the cutest and best dressed sales associate to provide us with a fitting room and start bringing things she liked.  This worked.  She was really sweet and helpful from start to finish.\n\nWithin minutes, she had tons of ideas and started loading us up.  One outfit after another, I sat and watched the fashion show, providing my opinion along the way.

Maybe this is because I'm never dressed in a three-piece suit, wearing a Ferragamo tie and top hat, though somehow, I don't think that this would help particularly, especially since I'm pretty sure that I could never reasonably afford to outfit myself with anything from the store... well, maybe a pair of socks...  Anyway, I was already at the Domain (the SLF wanted to do some wandering), and I needed new shoelaces for my brown dress shoes, so we head in to the Neiman Marcus, and by head in, I mean the girlfriend dragged me in while I left claw marks in the sidewalk.  Once inside, we head back to the men's shoe department, where we are greeted by an associate who is impeccably dressed- I swear that this guy could have been in a Bond movie, whereas I'm in a t-shirt, old shorts, and flip-flops.  Nevertheless, he treats us as I'm sure he would treat the Monopoly Man, and asks if he can be of any assistance.  One glance around, and we see no sign of replacement shoelaces.  He then checks behind the counter, confers with another associate, and then tells us that he's going to check in the back for a spare pair of laces.  He comes back very apologetic, but with shoelaces, saying that he's not sure that they will work, but to give them a try anyway.  He then gets a bag puts said shoelaces in the bag, and gives them to me with no charge.  I'm stunned.  The shoelaces are probably worth more than the shoes that they're now adorning.  I'm sure that I'd be back if I somehow mysteriously won the lottery, or a rich uncle that I didn't know about left me his entire fortune in his will, or whatever, but for now I'm just happy with the way I was treated and the new laces.", "date": "2008-07-02 20:49:18"}, {"review_id": "1Um4TxhOwaxKDiwMxMYyuw", "user_id": "72OpzOwUrxgjgzBElwvAPg", "business_id": "omC1_8kcbnJr1mXF8GgeRQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 9, "funny": 2, "cool": 8, "text": "This Neiman's isn't the largest I've been to, but let me tell you it is the one with the greatest customer service.

Austinians are wonderful indeed!\n\nI've found my personal shopper here.  His name is Nathan Idais and his passion and knowledge of high-end handbags far exceeds anybody I know.

He will get a sense of your style and reappear from his treasure chest ( the stockroom, lol) and take your breath away.  Hint: not everything is always on display because there simply isn't enough room.   I came in looking for the city Balenciaga, and left undecided among the YSL leather clutch in red, a pink leather logo Gucci tote, and the Chanel Grand Shopper Tote in black with the gold chain.  But do not fret because Nathan will make you his client who will receive his special attention. Under your profile he will note your style, size, preferences, and WANTS.  Now all I have to do is hand his card over to my significant other so he will have no headache shopping for my next special occasion gift *wink*.\n\nThis really is a gem among all the Neiman's I've been to.

We didn't realize it at the time, but we were extremely close to closing time. Even so, we were greeted immediately upon entry, and again several times while browsing. Not knowing it was basically closing time (it closes an hour before most of the rest of the shopping center), we took our sweet time looking around, holding stuff up, trying bags on, etc. We eventually made it to cosmetics where we sampled a few nail polishes, and I even asked a busy looking sales person for polish remover and she very kindly obliged. At this time, the metal gate was put down on the front entrance, and this was when we realized they were already closed. We had already selected one nail polish each to purchase, so we asked if we could still check out quickly and even though all of the sales people clearly looked to be in a small rush getting ready to close, several salespeople stopped to help and make sure we were taken care of. Once done, we were seen out by more friendly salespeople, and also given cute little cupcakes (although these were probably leftovers from the day?).\nMy point is, I found the customer service here very welcoming, accommodating, and friendly. Despite us being unintentionally horrible customers coming in so late and clearly not looking to drop any big money, we were treated very well and like any customer should be. This was in stark contrast to the Saks in Austin that closed recently, where we also accidentally went in close to closing time (I don't know why or how we managed that twice, oops!) and were ignored, then spoken to very shortly/rudely by a sales person who's persona then completely flipped once she realized my friend was purchasing something (nail polish, again--it's the cheapest thing there). Every sales person we encountered there was very rude and rather disdainful towards us.

Plus, the lady who acts like she's better than everyone at the perfume counter is very rude and pushy. The girl in Chanel is nice and had my first purse from them delivered which was great but when my straps broke I was to get charged half another Chanel purse to doc them. Same thing with my jumbo black Chanel. I won't be visiting this neimans again. Sad, sad.. You'd think they'd be nicer to people who spend their money there.

I wasn't able to get immediate credit for an exchange, but the Operations Manager, Rich, was able to ship my wallet overnight back to where I originally bought it.  Being at the 14-day point of return, he assured me that if I ever encountered a problem, to notify him and he would make sure I would receive credit.  He stated that LV leases their boutique within Neiman Marcus and they do not share the same store policies.  Good to know.\n\nAfter that matter was handled, I went to Chanel anyway to see what their selection was like.  Immediately upon entering the boutique, Maggie greeted us as if we were family.

She was also extremely patient with my requests to view multiple items and provided uninterrupted one-on-one attention despite other clientele waiting their turn for assistance.

My daughter and I had been shopping ALL day and perhaps looked a bit wrinkled, but only because we'd been trying on AND BUYING clothes the entire day. We went straight to the men's department and started looking for that perfect shirt. There were literally 6 salespeople standing around and NOT ONE asked us if we needed any help, or even looked our direction for that matter! Ultimately, we asked one salesperson if they had 'Thomas Pink', which is a brand of men's shirts that can run from about $60-$250. He curtly answered, \"oh, that would be at Nordstrom's\" and walked away, as if we we were beneath him. We walked over to the Hugo Boss section, found a suitable shirt but not in the size we needed, and STILL didn't have a single salesperson look our direction, much less attempt to assist us. We did find a perfect Burberry shirt costing $250. STILL not one person tried to assist us even though there was a snooty guy looking at text messages on his phone only 3 feet away! I will say he did a great job... of ignoring us! Although this costly shirt was perfect, we thought screw them, they don't deserve our business and started to walk away. I, being the type of person finding it very difficult not to speak up when an injustice is taking place, talked my daughter (a surgeon married to a surgeon) into walking back to give them a piece of my mind. Just then a woman by the name of Debbie, came by and asked if anyone was helping us. We told her that on the contrary, we couldn't get a single person to look our direction, much less actually help us! She said that she was the floor manager and that she'd noticed our looking around as if we needed something. I told her that this type of POOR SERVICE should be unacceptable at a store that prides itself on \"luxury\". I said that they should not be judging a book by its cover, and that they were missing out on sales by refusing to serve us. She apologized profusely, stated that she agreed 100%, and proceeded to try to assist us. As a result, we went ahead and purchased the $250 Burberry men's shirt (because it really was what we'd been looking for ALL DAY). Based on our experience, we will likely NEVER shop there again! Although this ONE floor manager did the right thing and was pretty awesome, it wasn't enough to counter the snooty salespeople working the floor! \nAs Maya Angelou said, \"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\"", "date": "2014-06-29 14:14:40"}, {"review_id": "9GpoOdkOAqLTQAUaYGG_fw", "user_id": "z1zQNIcfGeBAPdaaXXO2fg", "business_id": "omC1_8kcbnJr1mXF8GgeRQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 3, "cool": 0, "text": "The boutiques in Neimans do not look glamorous at all.

She's also known all the tricks of tailoring, which has meant as I've lost weight (and I've dropped about 70 pounds in the past 18 months), I've been able to keep much of the clothing I've bought along the way.  Some of what she and the tailors have done has resulted in some of my clothes fitting better now after massive alteration than they did when I first put them on.\n\nSlowly a lot of my old clothes are going to Goodwill, and I'm pleased that thanks to having the help of someone like Mila who knows fashion, my closet is getting thinned to where it has much fewer items in it -- but they're all of higher quality and much easier to mix and match.  And I'd rather have a few good things on hangars than a closet overstuffed with junk.\n\nBut that's the value add of a higher level of customer \"touch\" that you get at a higher end store.  And I've certainly seen that evaluated over the long haul, it's not much more difficult or expensive to be fashionable (and have a closet door that actually closes because there's not so much junk behind it).", "date": "2020-10-28 19:42:29"}, {"review_id": "gYohpOAO6Ds32TJVt8txOg", "user_id": "a7Gve8KjkWC_1vPIEtOAKw", "business_id": "omC1_8kcbnJr1mXF8GgeRQ", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 14, "funny": 15, "cool": 10, "text": "Neiman's in Austin is a true disappointment.

The store was packed and there were long lines for both the checkout and the fitting rooms, which had orange carpet! I did not see anything I was interested in purchasing.  There was a lot of  Stuart Weitzman, Michael Kors and other designer brands but the prices did not seem to me that much cheaper than regular retail.

One even looked up a purse for me on lastcall.com. Even though it wasn't there, it was cool that they could look up specific items at other stores and/or online for you. That's not something I usually expect from an outlet store. \n\nApparently they get a few different kinds of items: returns, out of season items, and some items that are ordered specifically for Last Call.

The Domain Neiman's only has Kate's sunglasses in right now. POOT.)\n\nFor some reason, I found Last Call slightly easier to browse than Austin's Nordstrom Racks. Maybe it was because the purse section was neatly organized by designer, or because the women's sections were organized very neatly by occasion (casual/dress/work/really sparkly dresses I could only *ever* wear if one of my student films got randomly picked up for an Oscar/etc., etc.). Nice, neat, and orderly sections that make sense make me happy when I'm browsing for things. \n\nIt was hard to find petite anything, but I was still able to find a few pairs of jeans mixed in among the tall people sizes.

The moment I was about to get a sales associate to retrieve the purse for me another associate came up with another customer  who wanted to buy it. I had literally missed my chance within seconds.

I walked in and was able to locate the purse section almost immediately. I roamed around and there it was. The purse I wanted and it was on the sale section. It was like my unicorn find! I looked for an associate to help me unlock it. One employee passed me. She didn't acknowledge me but she was in the process of helping another customer. That's alright because it led me to Angela. Her name really does represent her. She's an angel! She was so helpful. I wasn't dressed as a person of means but either way her customer service was top notch.

Not once was she frustrated and she didn't easily give up.There was a similar purse w/ strap at a lower purse. She asked her manager if they could switch out the straps. Sadly, they couldn't but I appreciate the thought and effort. The manager saw my disappointment and kindly offered me an extra % off. He knew how to make the sale and have a happy customer.

You never know what you'll find and if you're looking for something specific, it may be hard to find.  Also, the prices are much higher.  The only things I seriously considered (Will it work in my wardrobe?  I can only justify buying work attire these days) were some Splendid cardigans and jackets, but came to the conclusion that they were too casual for my workplace.  Handbags were nice, but the brands were not ones I usually like.  The shoe section is quite fun with some very nice high end shoes, but again, didn't find anything I could justify spending $$$ even discounted. \n\nI ended up walking out with only a house brand leather wallet because my old has been dying for the past year and I hadn't had the opportunity to find a new one.  I like very slim ones for every day use to just fit my license, 1 credit card, and a few bills and they had a small selection of small leather goods in a variety of colors and prints.  I think if you really like designer labels and have cash to burn, this should be a destination and part of your shopping rotation because there are definitely deals to be had.", "date": "2012-01-29 22:03:56"}, {"review_id": "WhBIU0gtQffm6XCywX0eDg", "user_id": "80fI46_H94JRq5Gb9rGoxA", "business_id": "Z5L2U8ct69m723ZNXufwOA", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "New wardrobe required for me.  100 degree weather rules out the majority of my Pacific NW clothing.  \n\nFreaking fabulous deals.

I went upstairs and my shoes were breathtaking. Once I showed proper identification, they asked me to try them on. I did and what do you know.....they didn't fit. They were flapping off the back of my feet (I ordered from the Christian Louboutin website twice and picked the wrong size). This was shipped to store in 2 days. I refunded them and got the money on a gift card and headed downstairs. Lindsey and the other lady graciously greeted me and I tried on several different shoes. Once I had my fun, I picked another pair of shoes (they didn't have the shoes I ordered in a size smaller) and talked to them about other shoes.

I'm still a bit  intimidated by how posh they are in the clothing and shoe departments however, I have three strong reasons to go if you're looking for something besides a $1400.00 Chanel silk shift.\n \n1. Their cosmetics department is great. I purchased all Bobbi Brown makeup for my wedding a few years back and the women doing my face were incredibly helpful and sweet, and I find their makeup amazing; very well-made and long-lasting with a range of great color palette. The saleswomen weren't pushy or critical, very laid-back, which I love and probably influenced my decision to purchase products I didn't need.\n\n2. The perfume department is lovely as well. Yesterday I was there looking for a citrus scent and the three people working at the counter were especially helpful. I didn't get their names but one woman was especially helpful and let me try on lots of different fragrances from Annick Goutal to Jo Malone to Vera Wang. At no point did she rush me. My only regret is that the perfume I fell in love with wasn't available in a smaller size so I ended up empty-handed. They have an incredible assortment of perfumes and colognes, so if you're a scent-fiend like me. Check it out!\n\n3. Lingerie. Not only are their variety of silk robes, pajama's and underwear so beautiful but the woman who assisted me was very tactful and had a great sens of humor (which I think is mandatory when you're dealing with underwear). I'm at the age when Spanx are needed and I purchased my first pair yesterday. I aint too proud to admit it!\n\nOh, another bonus is they often host fashion shows. Yesterday they had some kind of Eileen Fisher event and I bumped into a model, which was an other-worldly experience. They really do look like aliens.\n\nOnly 4 stars instead of 5 because I always notice that the salesladies in the clothing department tend to follow you around in an indiscreet manner.

Enclosed with the package was a gift receipt so I could return the necktie to Neiman Marcus for store credit or exchange the necktie for a different style necktie of equal value. I decided to do the latter.\n\nI went to Neiman Marcus at Lenox Square and was directed by one of the sales staff to Customer Service located on the top floor. If facing the mall entrance on the top floor of Neiman Marcus, Customer Service is tucked away and hidden down a hallway to the right. It's next to the restrooms.\n\nBefore going up to Customer Service, I went downstairs to the bottom level (men's section) to pick out an equal-value necktie for the swap.\n\nAt Customer Service, I was seen by Keshia Weaver. She was polite and helpful. I told her exactly what I wanted to do (a simple exchange), but it ended up taking longer than we expected. The reason it took longer than expected is because the necktie purchased online was ringing up as less expensive than the necktie I found in-store. The necktie purchased online was purchased at a discount or using a promotional offer.\n\nUnderstanding my situation, Keshia called Department Manager Randall Little who appeared in about five minutes. At first, Randall wouldn't honor my exchange request because the gift necktie was ringing up as less expensive than the in-store necktie. However, I explained I found the exact same necktie as my gift necktie in-store in the same bin as the necktie I picked out to exchange. In other words, these neckties were the same brand and general style and all were priced the same at full retail value.\n\nUpon learning this, Randall pulled out his iPhone, launched a Neiman Marcus app, and scanned the tags of the necktie I picked out in-store and the necktie I had received as a gift. The prices matched. Randall authorized Keshia to honor the swap. Due to tax and other mathematical issues I wasn't entirely privy to on the Neiman Marcus computer (Keshia and Randall spent a few minutes trying to figure it out), I ended up getting the tie I wanted plus a Neiman Marcus gift card with 13 cents on it.\n\nThe exchange took about 25-30 minutes. I didn't mind the wait too much since I wasn't in a rush, but I did think it was a bit excessive for a basic transaction. Keshia offered water and cookies for the delay which I thought was very nice. In the end, I left pleased with Neiman Marcus' Customer Service at Lenox.

One day, when my sales person was not in, I could not even get help locating items on the floor from the employees who were not my sales person. And when they do help, they do not actually engage in providing assistance because they apparently don't get paid to do so!

I usually go to Saks for my cords (love their sales), but because of where we parked we opted for Neiman's.\nWe got to the junior miss, or whatever they call the trendy clothes department, and I looked everywhere but the only place I could find for her to sit was this wickedly uncomfortable plastic seat.  She grinned and made the best of it, while I asked a lounging sales girl, who was chatting with the other lounging sales girls, if they had any cords.  She sort of waved in the direction of the sales rack and muttered something about how they had gotten in a couple of pairs of Seven's, and she thought they were gone, but maybe I'd find something there.\nI looked through the rack, found several pairs of Juicy cords (not Seven's), tried on a pair and decided to buy it.  I asked if they could hem them and they called the alterations lady, who pinned them up and then handed me a bill for $12.  I was surprised, but she said that was standard for jeans on sale.  When I got to the register, I decided to have them taken in, for the same price, at the neighborhood tailor, so I wouldn't have to go downtown to pick them up.  Surly girl number two shrugged, \"whatever\" and took the pins out.  When I got them home, I discovered that one seam was torn out along the waistline.\nNeedless to say, they went back, and no, I don't want them fixed, and no, I am not going there again.  \nWhy?  Well, let me tell you...\nHere's what I'm used to at Saks:\nI walk in, there are numerous, soft surfaces to sit on while waiting for someone, and a sales assistant approaches and asks if I need anything, then walks me to the racks and helps me to find the item I are looking for.  If I want something altered it is included.  Sale items, too.  And they will even post it to me, if I like, when it's finished. Done and done.\nThe Neiman's punchline:\nI returned the pants a couple of days ago.  I took them to customer service, rather than going to the department where I felt I was treated rudely.  I explained to the assistant manager what I felt had happened, she apologized and, when I said I really just wanted to be done with them, encouraged me to return them at the customer service desk next door.  When I went to do that I was told, bruskly, that I could only return catalog items there.\nI did ultimately return my pants (they are sending me a check, because they don't take credit cards at Neimans... excuse me?) but the surly woman who did it told me in the process that they ladies at the junior miss department are \"always like that\".\nWell, maybe they are, but who needs it?

He said that since I have already used the bag they can't do anything else for me. He did not recognize that it is a defect, while I explained to him that I have posted on forums to ask people who have owned over 10 Chanel bags and resellers who have seen hundreds of bags if this is common. Everyone on the forum who responded said that they have never seen such stitching problems on their bags, with the exception of one person who had the same issue in one of her many bags and was able to return it. I asked the Chanel store and they agreed that it shouldn't happen when the bag is still SO NEW. It is a joke that the Neiman cannot even offer an exchange for a bag which still has the plastic sticker on the hardware. How is the plastic sticker withstanding the wear better than the stitches on the bag? It makes NO SENSE. It is even more unacceptable that the issues were denied and dismissed. I took it to a local Chanel and the staff there could also see the stitching problems and said that they were really surprised that Neiman didn't do anything for me.

I have AMAZING childhood and early adult memories of Neimans; my family and I have cultivated great relationships throughout the years with numerous employees.  As crazy as it sounds it was kinda like a \"second\" home because it was the first outing my grandmother, and mother took me on 6 wks after I was born.  That said, when I moved to Atlanta, GA (2008) for my now husband's career, I was absolutely heartbroken by the cold reception I received at the NM @ Lenox. Yes, I am young, 27, and they didn't \"know\" me but to me customer service is a big deal! I was never greeted, helped, or even given the time of day.  Frankly, I stopped shopping at that location for a few yrs. and would just \"stock up\" when I went home or have my SA friends ship me what I needed.  The other day I was wandering around the Contemporary department \"CUSP\" and 2 female sales associates actually glared at me, never breaking stride in there conversation.  Then I walked to the other side of the floor where a male SA was on the phone. I stood there (patiently) for 5 full minutes waiting to ring up my purchase and he never once even acknowledged my presence. I walked away from the cash wrap to put my items back b/c clearly no one wanted to make a sale. As I was putting said items away, I turned to a woman who was walking by, asked her if she worked at NM and if she would kindly please ring up my sales. ( I was buying a gift for a friend who has just lost her dog) She grab the item out of my hand and wrung it up very quickly not even asking if I wanted it gift wrapped or sent with a note...which would have been nice because now my girl friend is going to have a random NM box delivered to her and have no idea who it came from...Awesome!  Such a bad Lenox NM experience and sadly wasn't my first with their crew. The ONLY reason I will shop/eat there going forward is because of Ms. Louise in Home & Fine China, Ms. Gloria in the Cafe, and Patrick in Men's Sportswear.

The She Crab soup and Herb Roast Chicken are my favorite. Don't forget their house made Ginger Peach Iced Tea.\n\nQuick update:\n\nDalynthia Johnson at Customer Service deserves a best service award. My friend ordered a Rimowa salsa carry on and found many scratches on the surface of bag when it was delivered to our condominium building. She went to the store and was helped by Dalynthia. They reordered again for my friend the exact same Rimowa and a week plus later, another carry on arrived. This time the zipper was broken. I can't believe too. This time I went to the store with her and again she was helped by Dalynthia. Dalynthia was very apologetic and extremely helpful in processing the return and rang up to do another reorder. She told the staff on the phone my friend had ordered twice before and twice the carry on showed up defective; she requested to make sure the 3rd one would be free of defects and in excellent condition. Today my friend's Rimowa came and it was in amazing condition. Who knows buying a Rimowa can be that much of a headache?? But thankfully my friend was assisted twice by Dalynthia who truly deserves a 5 stars award!", "date": "2016-12-29 23:37:31"}, {"review_id": "DrjcAdsRHCGmi_xS6jdlTg", "user_id": "H-Z39tyjqxqVi3kZ1u19JQ", "business_id": "6iK58YnsdUMC6TgtkWcBjw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Great help with a purchase over the phone.

My husband had purchased a Balenciaga bag (metallic edge city bag in red - Store Inquiries: #1647795) from Neiman Marcus in Natick, but upon seeing the item, I noticed the tips of the tassles on the zipper were rather worn and there was a slight oily mark. So, I went to the location at Copley Square yesterday (9/8) to exchange it with another one since the online information stated that this item was in stock at this location. \nWhen I went, the salesperson (Rocio Pena) made remarks like the bag looks fine, it will not ship from the factory anyway (naw, really? - sarcasm), and how she doesn't think they have it I asked for her to check, and she only looked at the little closet behind the mirrors. Since the neiman marcus website stated that i could purchase it and pick up the item at the store on the day, I figured it would be in the stock room. Well, she told me there was NO stock room. Nothing made sense, and I returned the bag, then asked her to order it for me. She refused first and told me to order it myself online. *Wow* When I went to the customer service floor, the lady there told me there was nothing for her to find out - if the manager of the handbag section tells me if it not available then that is it for me, nothing she can check or help me with. Ok.... So I went back up after finding out the name of the manager... I asked the salesperson to order it for me again since the website said it was in stock for me to pick up. She then took the manager to what appeared to be a stock room and returned. I heard the manager ask her if she checked the stock room, and she made an expression that it wasn't available. And she still didn't order it for me. And the manager, Tracey, didn't bother looking for it or checking the inventory either.\nWell, CLEARLY, the salesperson did not want to help me in any way because an exchange would not give her the commission. Rather than not helping, even lied that there was no stock room, and avoided ordering it when I asked her to order it both times. It seems obvious that she didn't want to get caught lying?\nIf it really was out of stock, they could have checked their inventory and showed me. SIMPLE.\nSo, thanks for ruining a gift because you (Rocio Pena) refused to exchange it or even bother helping in any way, and Tracey, a supposed manager, just walking around. Well, I guess Tracey checked one of the cabinets under the cash register machine, but she could have checked the inventory herself.\nAnd what sort of customer are they providing on the customer service floor? \nI will never return to this place to purchase anything.
