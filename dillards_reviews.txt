They had one associate working the entire department and I think this handbag department was at least the same size if not bigger than the Atlantic Station location. Seriously? One associate working this massive area on a Sunday? They had 3+ working on a Wednesday afternoon when I went to Atlantic Station. The woman in front of me on Sunday was returning like 3 or 4 handbags and each transaction had some kind of issue. Finally the associate called for a manager and she was able to take my return while the other women waited on the manager. The associate was clearly flustered with everything and barely even spoke to be during my return transaction. \n\nWhile I was waiting I observed several women who needed help or had questions for the associate but they ultimately left because they knew they weren't getting helped any time soon.

There is literally no way to enter through these doors and avoid falling into the \"betcha can't say no\" trap.  It happens to me every time and every time, I fall.  Ugggh!  \n\nAs soon as you enter the store, you will find yourself in the bag department where there is literally something for everyone including high-end and non-leather options.  The bags are all arranged by Collections so it is easy to find your favorite designer.  When it comes to bags, I think women largely stick with the same designer because they know what to expect.  I love a particular designer because he uses very supple drum-dyed leather and his linings are beautiful.  He always has his trademark slit pocket on the outside of the bag and inside, there is great organization. So what you will want to do is find your perfect bag and then walk across the aisle to the shoe department.  \n\nThis has got to be the most well stocked shoe department in Georgia.  They literally have everything right now.  They have flip-flops, slippers, loafers, tall boots short boots, snow boots, western designs, sneakers, heels flats, sandals, cute shoes that don't compromise comfort and style, dress shoes for those holiday parties and great color options.  As soon as I walked over, Steve offered his assistance and there was a particular style of shoe that interested me, (open toe and heal with an ankle strap and stacked heel).  He brought out about six boxes and I nixed the first five because the heel was too high.  As I lifted the top off of the sixth box, I almost lost it because this was the shoe that I tried to purchase in Ohio a few months ago.  It was sold out!  After retrieving my perfect size, they held the shoes while I continued shopping, (so that I would not have to carry the bag around).  I now have a perfect fall to spring sandal!  Yes!!\n\nIf I could only shop one shoe store for the remainder of my life, this would be it!  Hands down, it is the best.

Both the Atlantic Station and Perimeter Dillard's have absolutely enormous women's sections, with plenty of dresses for any occasion. I also like they they always have some sale racks as well.\n\nWhat I don't like is Dillard's no price adjustment policy. Seriously? I feel like every store is willing to price adjust to some capacity, but Dillard's refuses to. Their return policy is 30 days. I guess that is standard for department stores... not sure. I am spoiled by other stores' 90 day policy (e.g. Target).\n\nA price adjustment would have been nice, because I bought a Gianni Bini dress for a wedding that I am in, in the store, for full price. A month or so later, I spotted the dress on their website for $60 off. SIXTY DOLLARS OFF. By this time, the 30 day window for returns had passed. However, a $60 savings was too tempting to pass up, so I bought the dress online with the intention of returning the store-bought dress for store credit.\n\n(Just a note. When I received the dress in the mail, they forgot to include a printout of the receipt. Thought that was odd. I literally just received the dress with no paperwork whatsoever.)\n\nI returned the store-bought dress with no problems and was issued a gift card. I then later spent it on more clothes online, since they were having a pretty decent sale. A couple of items in my shopping cart were labeled as non-returnable, which I was OK with. I was willing to take the risk. There was a dress though that I was more unsure of, but I decided to proceed with the purchase since it was NOT labeled non-returnable. However, after I clicked \"Submit\" to process my purchase, I noticed that dress was also labeled as non-returnable. Um, why didn't it say so before? If that was the case, I might not have purchased it. I was kind of miffed about that. \n\nBottom line -- if they would just allow price adjustments, it would have saved me a lot of hassle.

Yesterday, I went to the Dillard's store at the Domain in Austin. I had received an adorable Vera Bradley tumbler for Mothers Day from my daughter. I loved it but it was broken; both the straw and the bottom of the cup. My intention was to exchange it, but after seeing that there were no cups to change it with, I requested a cash refund. I had the original receipt. I was told that I could only receive money credited back to the debit card by which the purchase was made. Obviously I didn't purchase my own gift therefor I didn't have my husband's debit card. I was told no cash could be given, only store credit. I HAD THE RECEIPT!! The associate proceeded to call a manager and I was directed upstairs. I was trying to enjoy an evening of shopping with my daughter but realized that fighting for what is right was a valuable lesson for her to learn. Upstairs I was again told the Dillard's policy about a refund. My problem was, my husband was sold a defective product of which the store had no replacement, so therefor I wanted a cash refund. Ultimately a cash refund was given, and all associates were respectful and kind but this policy has caused me to not return as a Dillard's customer. My my family over the last 2 weeks spent at least $300 and I have always shopped at Dillard's. but how can I, in good conscious buy a gift for someone knowing that if they don't like it and can't find something comparable that they like, will be forced to accept a Dillard's gift card. Not every town in America has a Dillard's and if returning a gift it might be their only opportunity to shop. My dad would be a prime example of that. Were I to give him, say, a shirt that didnt fit. He might not find replacement he liked and would be issued a gift card that would then never be used, because he is a busy doctor who pays little attention to things like that.

However, every time I am in the store I feel like it's a ghost town. No customers. And no sales associates when you need one. \n\nNot sure how this store is staying in business, but then again I guess that's not my problem. I just think it would be such a waste to see such a nice, new store close in the near future due to the lack of sales from potential Austin customers. The Domain is a hopping spot and definitely my stomping ground, so I am fully aware of the fact that every other large retailer has tons of shoppers in their stores on a regular basis. The Macy's down the way in the Domain always has some kind of sale going on and different events in their stores so people are always in there. I wonder if this Dillard's just doesn't have a good PR person to get more people in the store or to push any of their sales or shopping events?\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves every time I come in here, is that I have to hunt down a sales associate when I have a question or need to checkout. I bounce from department to department looking for someone. No one has really ever approached me to ask if I need assistance in the 15-20 times I have come in to this location. Also, when I do have a question, the girls typically don't have a very helpful answer - they all seem very inexperienced. Imagine if you had more seasoned sales people? You could be closing many more sales in this store!\n\nAlso, I really love the brand BCBGMaxAzria, and they have an exclusive boutique upstairs with a great assortment of product. But the one time I attempted to make a return on a dress I decided I really wasn't that in love with. The sales associate would not accept the return because there was a discrete snag somewhere on the dress. She was super tacky and proceeded to tell me that I had worn the dress and that I wouldn't be allowed to return it. However, I never wore the dress and most likely purchased the dress with the snag already on it...without me even noticing. What a waste of $150. Never wore the dress because I disliked it that much and ended up donating it to Goodwill. I know the BCBG department kind of acts as a separate business within Dillard's, but if you are going to have this brand representing a huge portion of your store, make sure the BCBG employees treat the rest of your Dillard's customers respectfully. \n\nI will say this store is very clean, and merchandised really well.

That's all over for us now. Monday morning(Jan 1st) I waited outside laughing and comparing stories with the other women excited to get to the goods....I always come prepared with my totes to carry all the Christmas decor I'll be getting......everything was great! I was there for hours, my bags were full, I was rolling luggage that I wanted...... In that time I'd sit in an \"out of the way\" spot and separate my must haves, maybes, and put back. After I put one bag full back in it's appropriate area(instead of just stashing it wherever) I decided to go ahead and buy my must haves(short line in the men's department so I went for it) then I could see how much I've spent and decide on my maybes. This is when a police officer approached me and assured me I'd not be leaving with the bags that I had set aside. I was shocked that he assumed I would and was like \" uhhhh I know\" I mean duhhhh! Even the guy checking me out knew I set the bags to the side! So after that this cop and another security guy would not get off my heels. I continued shopping and was doing my last scan to see if I missed anything.....called my mom to compare what they got at their Dillard's in Houston and I was sitting on a display bed right in front of the Christmas section(the busiest area) taking out all the ornaments and keeping my musts and putting the ones that I didn't need or had too many of......that's when the cop and his side kick approached me again and firmly said \" I'm done playing these games with you, turn around\" I was obviously confused and thought he wanted me to look at something behind me or something and he put HANDCUFFS on me in the middle of the store and made me sit in front of everyone for about ten minutes handcuff like a criminal. I've never been more mortified in my whole life. I live in the Domain where this Dillard's is located, I'm a hairstylist with honest and loyal clients and the thought of my neighbors or clients seeing me sitting in handcuffs on a display bed is so beyond embarrassing. I had to explain fifty million times what I was doing before he took the cuffs off of me and let me get the things I wanted. When I left I called my sister bawling my eyes out.......I felt so dirty, mortified, confused. We all ended up taking everything we got the next day, Brittany the store manager was really apologetic to me and was on my side(thank you Brittany) All I want is for that officer to apologize to me though.

I got two BCBG 100% rayon dress at 70% off.  When I jokingly asked Nathan I. what 30% of $98 her said, \"Nothing.  They are free.\"  Yes, less than $30 for a BCBG is a summertime miracle and it's not even summer.

I don't make the rules, I just know what they are and I abide the best I can.  \n\nIn addition to the ridiculous deal on the dresses, I also scored on some cute Alex Marie 1/2\" flats that have a padded footbed for $24.99.

After getting the run around at the store, manager Robert Stelker told me didn't have the authority to honor my request and that he would get back to me. Five days later he called to tell me that my request could not be honored. I was dumbfounded at that moment, hence this review.

While amused by this story, I'm still not sure why my clothes didn't come from Baby Dior. Then again, I wasn't even born, so I couldn't complain about it yet. But I digress.\n\nThe point is, I've grown up always liking Dillard's. It's no Neiman Marcus, and I'd rather hurl myself off a cliff than wear anything by their house brand Roundtree & York, but it's a solid, decent department store with well-known \"better\" brands. I also like their approach to marketing. Unlike Macy's--with their perpetual \"one-day\" sales, worthless/misleading coupons, and utterly confusing pricing policy--Dillard's doesn't play that game. You either pay retail, or wait for a modest sale. If you can find something on sale, good for you. If not, wait a little while. Dillard's always seems much more \"composed\", too. If the stores were celebrity siblings, Dillard's is Luke Wilson, and Macy's is his less put together, kind-of-a-hot-mess-but-still-endearing sibling, Owen. You get the picture.\n\nAs I usually am when I go shopping, I'm on a mission for an extremely specific item, and the other day it was black Emporio Armani undershirts. I knew Dillard's carried them because the styles I wanted were all online. I know purchasing online is easier, but I wanted to get a good look at the new-ish Dillard's Domain.\n\nThe store is visually quite appealing. Bright lights, clean displays, a place for everything and everything in its place. Walking to the escalators, I couldn't help but take a look at the jewelry, since the bright pink Betsey Johnson display caught my eye. It was also cool to see Korto Momolu from Project Runway a few seasons back had launched her accessories line. OK, I'm getting distracted. Gotta go upstairs to the little boy's section.\n\nThe underwear was easy to find. There it was--an entire display of Emporio Armani underwear. But of course, all in white. #$@%^!\n\nI searched drawer by drawer until I found the equivalent of what I wanted (3-pack, crew neck undershirt) in white. A salesman came over and I asked him to check and see if they 1.) Came in black at all, and 2.) If any other store had them. He said that only Barton Creek had them, and six packages at that. No need to put them on hold. But the Dillard's Domain, the one place you think would have them, didn't.\n\nAs I descended the escalator, not even Julia Robert's smile on the new Lancome advertisement could help me get over my irritation. Once again, my myopic search had left me empty handed, except now I can say I got to see the new Dillard's. \n\nEpilogue: I went to Barton Creek, and that Dillard's told me they had no idea what the guy at the Domain was talking about. They had zilch. So on a whim, I went to Macy's. And to my pleasant surprise, they had my black crew necks instead. Whaddaya know?

She used one of my favorite serums and massaged my temples, then a serum for my eyes and I immediately started to feel better.

SELL ME SOMETHING he answered quickly how I could look below at the bottom sign of what's included and price,a little blown away by the response I still kept my cool because I wanted to leave with this gift I had in mind. The same gentleman was not at all interested in selling me anything went to help somebody checkout which STILL DIDN'T BOTHER ME, actually gave me some time to read gift sets boxes as he instructed me to do and smell a few other colognes. The other female associate that was initially having a convo with the the first gentleman was still around the counter as I proceeded to ask her if I could get help with my purchase she shockingly replied \" I work in the Chanel dept you can wait for him\" as she pointed to her other colleague.i guess that was that last straw because I can tell you I had enough. I walked out of that store so fast drove down to Macy's and received awesome help which by the way she even up sold my purchase to a bigger set that I was originally looking at.

This is not your average Dillard's. As others have said, It's a clearance Dillard's. You can get amazing deals for great prices. That being said, it does take some patience. This place isn't really organized. They do sort things into men's, women's, home, shoes, kids, etc., but there's not really a rack for each designer - unless you want a higher end designer dress. \n\nYou have to sift through lots of clothing you probably wouldn't wear to find the gems. Once you find things you would like to try on, you can only take six items into the fitting room, but the lines are always long. The fitting rooms really do smell, but then again, they don't maintain the store well.\n\nMake sure you inspect your items well. There's no returns, exchanges or refunds at this store, but you really can find a lot of good deals.

I honestly had no intention of buying anything.  I just wanted to compare the price points of Dillard's suits to other stores.  I have only shopped at Dillard's once, that was a pair of dress shoes.  My suits needed a serious make over.\n\nI must say that I've always been hesitant to browse Dillard's because I was always under the impression their clothing was too expensive for a budget like mine.  And you must also keep in mind that this Dillard's is a smaller store due to Oviedo Mall being smaller.  They may not have the selection the larger stores have.\n\nMy wife, daughter and I walked in to the men's suit department and we were immediately greeted by Roberto.  We have seen him multiple times and said hello walking through the store to/from the parking lot.  But we've never had a conversation with him.  He asked me what I was looking for and I said I was looking at suits.  He asked me what my budget was and I was honest in saying it's on the lower end.  He showed me a few options but I wasn't too fond of the quality.  I upped my budget and that immediately opened my options up quite a bit.\n\nI looked at various suits with price tags that kind of scared me.  Roberto reassured me and said, \"let me scan it first to let you know what the price is.\"  Sure enough, it was on sale.  I had a navy suit picked out but it needed sizing done.  I asked him about the details on having tailor work done.  He said they do it there and it's included with purchase.  I was amazed at that because that's rare.  You buy a suit from most department stores and you're on your own time and dime to get it altered.  As most guys know, off the rack suits are made to fit a wide variety of guys.  Most common alterations are sleeve and pant length.\n\nHe had me try the suit on with their shoes so he could get an idea on length.  He marked the pants and jacket and said it would be ready in a week or so, he would call when it's ready.\n\nThen I spotted another suit, a charcoal suit.  I looked at the price and was hesitant as this suit cost more than the navy suit.  However, Roberto said to let him scan it.  He scanned and sure enough it was on sale.  He did the same with me trying the suit on and marking it for alterations.\n\nNow came the part of getting shirts and ties.  He measured my neck and sleeve length and came back with various options that were on sale/clearance.  He knew I was on a budget and made a conscious effort to keep me within budget.  Roberto has a great sense of style, something I don't have, and came back with 5 shirts.  I decided to buy 3 of the 5 and he showed me some ties.  I also bought 2 ties.\n\nIn all, we were mutually beneficial.  He helped my wardrobe immensely and I believe I helped him towards his sales goal.\n\nRoberto will be my go to guy for clothing.  Nothing against any of the other associates working there but I doubt they could top the experience we had with Roberto.\n\nIt's also important to note that during this entire time, we were not the only customers.  He was juggling not only multiple customers but also phone calls.

While most of it is for women (and an interesting shoe area that often looks like a war zone), there is a decent sized men's area with a wide range of clothes. Whether you are looking for nice suits or good weekend shirts, this place has you covered. I spent several hours in here with my wife looking for clothes for me as well as gifts for the holidays. I was able to buy several pairs of shirts and pants for a fraction of their regular price. While I could potentially find them cheaper online, the low prices offered at a major store with superior quality clothing and dressing rooms makes this the best option for buying clothing imaginable.\n\nOverall, the Fashion Square Mall is what I would call the \"adult's thrift shop,\" which means a great place to try on and buy a wide range of great clothes for great prices.", "date": "2016-03-21 23:00:02"}, {"review_id": "AGCh0C1l3q1DD86ZSz3T4Q", "user_id": "wlWNPP84F70It_l6OP2_mA", "business_id": "4kdNpMRTCOG6ntWQTS2XNQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 42, "funny": 13, "cool": 24, "text": "An entire store just for clearance items from Dillard's all over.

One thing was certain though, my drawer full of old VS bras wasn't gonna cut it anymore.  I was warmly greeted by the sales clerk and when I explained my situation she immediately asked, \"When was the last time you were measured and fitted?\"  Ummmm, never?  She escorted me to the fitting room, took a few measurements and asked a couple questions to decide what type of fit/shape would suit me.  She stepped out for a couple minutes and returned with 3-4 options for me to try.  I hesitated for a brief second when I realized that she wasn't going to leave and let me try them in private but I thought what the hell, it's not like she hasn't seen it all before!  \n\nLiterally within 10 minutes I was at the register paying for my new unmentionables.  I felt (and looked) amazing!  Who knew that the right bra could give you an instant makeover?!  Seriously, I looked at least 10 lbs lighter.

So as we entered Dillards we went to the furniture department to look around. We have been wanting to get a recliner recently, so we entered a room where there were many to choose from and we both sat down in two sepearte chairs. As my fiance was literally saying, \"I could afford to buy two of these..\" we were approached by a man named Bob Krick, he seemed like he was in a hurry and said, \"You are not allowed to lounge in the chairs. My manager is telling me you have to leave and go back out into the mall...\" I was stunned because as previously mentioned we had purchased a couch before we were actually told to try out different ones. Mu fiance mentioned to Bob that we had actually purchased a couch here and the guy laughed. As we got up and left I was urging my fiance to go back and get the guys name and his manager's name. I have been working in retail for over 2 years, so I am aware of good and bad customer service. When we went back we asked for his card and he agreed to give it to us, but instead of handing it over he tried to explain himself. \"Well a lot of teenagers come and lounge and jump on mattresses...\" We quickly told him we were in our 20's and he immediately responded, \"Almost teenagers..\" We told him how we were looking to register and bought furniture before and again he said, \"You? haha..\" --like he didn't believe us. I let him know that we were treated very rudely and he tried to explain his \"teenager theory\" and I told him \"This is why you shouldn't make assumptions about people who look young...\" Finally I asked for the card once more and his manager's name (Terry) and we left. I don't even know if I want to register here anymore. We weren't even being loud or disruptive or even running around, we were simply browsing--and he was still so quick to kick us out completely.

Based on the lack of management interaction on Yelp is another indication they are missing the mark. I see many positive reviews for the makeup department and it may be because those people are motivated by commission....same for shoes. BUT the disconnected is with every other department. It's nearly impossible to get someone to help you in the dressing rooms or to ring you up. They are busy checking in new merchandise and the staffing levels are abysmal. One girl was working the bottom half of the store alone. She put me in a dressing room near the BCBG department which subleases space from Dillard's and has their own staff. When I asked someone for a different size she said that she worked for BCBG and couldn't help me. At least 7-8 minutes went by before the original girl came to check back and she seemed put out when I asked her to bring me a dress in another size! \nThe reason people still shop in brick and mortar stores is so they can get good service and touch and try on the merchandise! Retailers are loosing customers to online merchants and the way to differentiate themselves is to step up staffing and training. Look at Nordstom's successful model. I noticed deeply discounted racks of merchandise throughout the store and wondered if some of it might have sold at a higher price if the customer's had received attentive service.

A girlfriend registered mostly pajamas for her bridal shower registry. The online shipping fee would've been $10. I had to go to the dinnerware section to print out her registry, even though she didn't register any dinnerware. I printed out the category, $25 and under, at the kiosk. Their registry printout isn't intuitive like Macy's, Crate and Barrel, Bed Bath and Beyond, or Target. There's nowhere on the printout that tells you which section to go to. There were several selections listed in the $25 and under category, which listed the price as N/A. When the first sales associate walked me to the Eileen West section, it was clear all the nightgowns started at $68. She had no clue how to look up the correct size or UPC number. Then she told me that I needed to scan it myself to take it off the registry upon checkout. What? I don't have a scanner. You do. She was clueless so she said she would get a second sales associate to help me.\n\nThe second sales associate was just as clueless. I told her the Eileen West selections listed on the printout were not $25 and under, as described. She randomly wanted me to pick an Eileen West nightgown on the clearance rack. I had to explain to her that I can't pick a random item, with a random UPC code not listed on the registry. She walked away with the printout to ask for help. When she returned, she asked, \"Oh! Did you find something?\" I said, \"No, because you have the registry printout with the UPC numbers. How am I supposed to know which item is on the registry?\" She walked back to the register and it was clear she wouldn't figure it out anytime soon. I offered to walk to customer service. \"Yes, please go to customer service\", she said. Another associate standing next to her told her she should have called the manager a long time ago. Waste of my time. This is why I never shop at Dillard's unless I have no choice.\n\nI walked to customer service and she didn't know, but she was very helpful. She had a positive attitude of wanting to learn and paged three managers, two of who were out to lunch. The third manager was the only person on the entire floor who knew how to scan a registry item at checkout, to remove it off the list. The manager forgot to print a gift receipt, but at least it had the sticker. The customer service associate did a really good job of complimentary gift wrapping, apologized for my poor experience, and wished me a blessed day. Thank you!\n\nAt the bridal shower, there were duplicate presents because sales associates at both the Domain and Barton Creek didn't know how to scan and remove items off a registry! Guests walked out the store after paying because they couldn't find someone to scan and remove items. Poorly trained staff everywhere!\n\nTL;DR\nOrder the bridal registry gift online with a pick up in store option to save $10 on shipping.

For me, thoughts of manual labor or having to perform menial tasks for someone else' pleasure is the stuff that gives my nightmares shape. However, sometimes this little phrase works wonders when validating a quick trip out of the office to help my friend L find a bridesmaid's dress at the mall. Twist my arm. \n\nI like this Dillard's; always have. It's certainly not as sparkly and glittery as The Domain, but they have a decent mix of products from their different lines, spanning all the departments. As soon as we walked in, L said I could go browsing wherever I wanted to, which was quite welcomed. Contrary to the stereotype, I really don't like helping girls pick out clothes. Mostly because for a lot of girls, shopping can be this huge, dramatic emotional roller coaster of an event that can stretch for hours and yield no results. Or maybe I'm just scarred from shopping with my mother. Conversely, I also prefer to shop for clothes myself without any outside influence; I know what looks fabulous, and I don't need anyone pressuring me or invading my space or making me spend money on crap I'll return. So, chalk that up to another \"But I thought all gay guys liked doing that\" cliche, and let's move along. \n\nThe fine china department always draws me in like a moth to a flame, or in this case a flamer to upscale dinnerware. I glanced at the Kate Spade pattern my friend had registered for her wedding, and it was this adorable pattern with silver polka dots. And then, from across the room, I saw a china pattern I haven't seen in years. (And yes, there was an audible gay gasp).\n\nMy parents own 8-place settings of the Lenox \"Autumn\" pattern, which had been introduced in 1918, but retired long ago. It's a gorgeous old guard pattern with beautiful floral motifs and the jeweled colors of autumn flowers; \"a classic Lenox tradition that continues to appeal to every generation\". Of course it does. I only care about it so much, because it'll be mine someday. \n\nAn extremely nice older salesman asked if he could help, and I asked if I could see a price list of accent pieces. He confessed it was his fifth day on the job, and that I'd have to speak to the head saleslady, Rita. While we waited, he asked what I was looking for, and I responded that I was toying with the idea of buying a matching platter or teapot for my parents for Christmas. Somehow it got around that I would be inheriting their collection later on, so he came out and laughed and said \"So you're basically buying a gift for yourself?\" Well...yes. Great. Now even strangers think I'm a greedy asshole. \n\nFinally, Rita was more than happy to give me a printout from an early 90's computer with the complete price list. I asked her when \"Autumn\" had returned, and she responded that it had only recently, at the request of Julie Nixon Eisenhower, President Nixon's daughter. Apparently, it was her wedding china. Rita was quite helpful, and informative to boot.\n\nIt was time to reconnoiter with L at the Clinique counter. She found a nice Ralph Lauren dress, but what she was really dying for was Clinique's current free gift with purchase. I asked if there was something in particular about the gift she wanted, and she bluntly responded \"No, I just want the damn free gift.\" We let the aggressive saleswoman take a few minutes to push $50 face cream on her AND me, which is always not very fun to deal with when you aren't in the mood to buy. But hey, that's their job. A $21.50 moisturizer purchase later, and L owned a new base, lipstick, eyeliner, brush, and a nifty makeup bag. \n\nWe thought about bringing our coworker back lunch from the food court, but it was too far away from us and hello--the food court? \n\n4 Stars for the Barton Creek Dillard's, both for solid brands and solid service.", "date": "2011-09-22 00:56:01"}, {"review_id": "8p8QsVJv2nyrPOrNgYsZuQ", "user_id": "ESGUkZezh9JnaHfPYqye0w", "business_id": "BU1oUyCIxyIeSfzS-77JQQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "This was my first time in Dillard's (I always considered it a low-budget Sears, even though Sears itself is low budget).

I've found them to be difficult.  \n\nAs an example, recently, tried to return two dresses purchases online with my credit card.  Happened to have a Dillard's bag, so instead of carting them through the store in the box that they were shipped in, I put them in this bag.  They wouldn't take the return without the shipment box.  Luckily, I happened to have this in my car, planning on tossing it in the trash.  So I had to go back out to my car and cart this box through the store... which is fine, other than why?  I've just always found them to have these odd rules and requirements that are never quite spelled out and unlike other department stores. \n\nI also think there is a huge lack of training among associates which may make some appear unprofessional.  This doesn't necessarily hinder my ability to shop there, but it's a head's up.  It's not a customer-oriented store. \n\nThat being said, they have a great little area with a large selection of costume jewelry on sale (typically half-price) that is always replenished and seems to never go away.

She let me shop around and swatch anything I liked while she helped other customers. I could tell she was just as lovely with others as well. Thanks Ashley!

She approached me and asked what I was looking for and when I mentioned I was looking to purchase new face wash she looked at me and asked \"for acne\"? Okay look, I know what I look like but that's the kind of thing you wait for customers to mention or maybe suggest within a consultation not right off the bat. On top of that it takes a few more questions to identify what's right for a client even if they have a few blemishes. I still bought a couple of items from her but I would have rather given the commission to Ashley and I'm not sure why I didn't just take the products over to MAC. \n\nMy experience in the shoe department was absolutely lackluster.

For those of you who do not like long winded personal perspectives skip the next few paragraphs. \n\nI owned 2 clothing stores for 10 years and it ruined me for the whole shopping experience. After 10 years of going to trade shows and picking out clothes for other people I have no desire or need to shop for myself since I have 3 closets and a spare bedroom full of clothes. So, why on earth would I ever even think of going to a Dillard's in a mall? My Daddy insisted that he pay for some makeup and \"modern\" accessories for me for my Sister's upcoming wedding and gave me my Mom's Dillard's credit card because he knows me so well and knows I would show up without either. \n\nSo, why am I reviewing a Dillard's and giving them 4 stars. Well, I will tell you. \n\nSamira made my day! I stopped by the Clinique counter last week  looking for a foundation that I liked the last time I ever wore makeup for the wedding pictures. I told Samira straight up that I never ever wear anything more than tinted moisturizer and just needed the minimum for a photo shoot. She proceeded to wash my face and evaluate my skin - I have very dry skin and big pores. She gave me wonderful facial massage dabbed on some Pore Minimizer that instantly shrunk my pores and made my skin look smooth as a baby's butt - why do I need any makeup when this stuff makes my skin look so smooth? Well, they just got in their new line of mineral-rich Superbalanced Powder Makeup and decided to use me as their ginny pig and parade me all around showing off their new product. I purchased the poor minimizer and the powder makeup and got outside and hated the way my face looked like I was wearing makeup. \n\nSo, my experience today returning the makeup is why they get 4 stars. I went in to return the makeup and was not looking to purchase anything else. Until, I saw the free gift with purchase and acted dumb so I could get another free facial and skin evaluation. I decided on the small Clarifying Lotion for extra dry skin and a wonderful plum colored lip gloss so I could get a \"Free Bonus with any purchase of $21.50 or more\". \n\nThe Ladies in the lingerie and jewelry department were also super helpful today. \n\nBut, it was all about the free gift bag - big enough for my other travel toiletries filled with useful free goodies (Full Potential Lip Pump and Shine in a violet shimmer shade, Even Better Skin Tone Corrector, Liquid Facial Soap Mild, Long Last Lipstick in Sugared Maple, Blushwear Cream Stick in Rose Blush and High Impact Mascara in Black). Free gift today until supplies run out.  As much as I despise makeup I still got all girly giddy over my free gift items!", "date": "2009-09-08 02:08:52"}]
