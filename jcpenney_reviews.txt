At this Sephora you can make an appointment in advance and get a full makeover, but you must then purchase atleast $50 worth of beauty supplies or atleast a $50 giftcard from Sephora.

My fiancee needed a professional headshot for her medical residency applications. Her med school classmates recommended JCPenney Portraits. After seeing the results of some of her classmates' photos, we were both convinced JCPenney would be a good option. She booked an appointment online. This JCPenney is the closest one to us. It's also the only one in metro Atlanta that's inside the perimeter. The others are located way out in the burbs.\n\nWe showed up at the appointment time and there was a small wait. There was a family in front of us who was having some family portraits made. We could hear the photographer trying to get the children's attention as she snapped photos. There was one lady working at the front desk who was checking people in and out. There was another family on their way out and a family that showed up behind us. This was my first time at a portrait studio. Apparently, this one was popular with families (maybe they all are; I have no idea). This visit was on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile we waited for the photographer to finish with the group ahead of us, we chose which backgrounds we wanted. We were handed a sheet with over 20 backgrounds to choose from. Since this was a professional headshot, we kept it clean and simple by choosing solid gray and white backgrounds. After the photos were taken, there was no question the photos with the white background turned out better than the ones with the gray background.\n\nIt's interesting how they change backgrounds. The backgrounds are hung on rails like shower curtains so the photographer can quickly swipe from one background to another. It's quick and efficient.\n\nThe actual shoot itself was also quick and efficient. The studio was small and, in addition to the numerous backgrounds, had all sorts of props. There was a small mirror my fiancee used to check her hair. Of course, there was a whole professional lighting setup and a computer that instantaneously displayed pictures as they were taken, populating them into an album for us to click through later.\n\nBrittany was our photographer and she was super friendly. She had my fiancee do a few poses and we were done in a matter of minutes. I could tell Brittany was a pro and had done professional headshots a countless number of times. I like how she kept an upbeat attitude. After the photo session was done, she escorted us to a computer in the waiting room where clicked through the photos she had just taken. They all turned out great. Brittany did a wonderful job.\n\nCheck JCPenney Portraits' website for coupons: https://www.jcpportraits.com/. We used a headshot coupon for three high-res digital images for $69.99. There is a standard $9.99 session fee, but we got ours for free. A link to the photos was emailed in about 1.5 hours. Fast. My fiancee was happy and satisfied with how the headshots turned out. I think they look terrific.\n\nThe only quibble my fiancee had was she wished Brittany had a finer attention to detail when it came to my fiancee's appearance. I think my fiancee kind of felt thrown into the fire as soon as she entered the studio room. She wanted to make sure she looked right before the flashes started going off. Perhaps she already looked fine, but some reassurance probably would have made her feel more confident and comfortable for the shoot.\n\nWe were in and out in what seemed like no time at all. If you need professional headshots taken quickly and at a reasonable price, I do recommend JCPenney Portraits. It's a nice little operation they have here.", "date": "2019-08-20 13:38:41"}, {"review_id": "Y6AbTuc_XqdQBlPcqbgoSA", "user_id": "zbxZLLCLzOjsdc8mXWn7sw", "business_id": "z_0lXdeO-o3pncDnOonXcA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Very positive experience.

Baby section was cute, but completely disheveled: clothes on the floor, pulled off hangers and stuck over tops of racks, little packages opened with their contents spewed all over the displays.... Horrors. Lingerie was fine, but seemed pretty grandma centric: Lots of beige sateen materials, full figured cup sizes, and panties that go to the belly button - and beyond! Juniors? Like I said, it was torturous. Plenty of adorable things in weird fabric combinations that would pill when you washed them the first time, or the seams would rip through the faux silk.

The only reason I think they were called family restrooms was because they could have fit a family of seven in them. Other than that, they were dirty and had no sitting area for moms to breast feed. However, there was a bench designed by Satan right outside of the family restrooms, with practically zero padding and no back support whatsoever. Not only that, but the bench was immediately next to the office area, so Looky Lous and Nosy Nancys kept waltzing by, eyeballing me like I was stealing cheap assed Juniors clothing. Halfway through the feeding, I look up and notice a HUGE security camera, pointed right at the bench. Thanks, JC Penney. REALLLLLLY comfortable.

Josh told us that we can take home try it and return it if we don't like it. Today when we came back to return it took us 50mins and four different persons . We found out that it was actually extended warranty not just a cover. Apparently Josh is the only person who knows how to return it. The most disappointment part was the comment that Josh made in the end \" I hope you know that you are making a big sacrifice\". We felt he lied and was unapologetic .", "date": "2015-04-25 20:40:17"}, {"review_id": "L8NdQAPOXNWu-oV0uLFqDQ", "user_id": "FGkySKSuG6ZjAkGXlsMVXw", "business_id": "aJKvxhSpN3gTiuJgc0PpZw", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm not a \"shopper\".

JCPenney is really one of the only places to shop in Davenport, so if I need to grab something or don't feel like fighting I-4 traffic I come here.  \nThe pros- This JCPenney has a Sephora inside it so you can get some quality makeup and perfumes.  The salon inside this store has some really good stylists who can cut/color your hair for pretty reasonable prices.  JCP is always offering coupons for $10 off $25, or $10 off $10 so they have some really great deals.  I got a pair of blue jeans for 87 cents one time.  How can you beat that?  It's a great place to get \"the basics.\".  I have lots of plain t-shirts, black dress pants for work, and khakis from here  \nThe cons -  They don't have wifi in the salon and the service in the building is awful, so don't expect to play on your phone will you get your hair done. The quality of the products is hit or miss.  Some stuff is pretty nice. My Liz Claiborne stuff seems to stand the test of time pretty well, but I've had a few things from here fall apart pretty quickly.  I don't buy St. John's Bay anymore.  It seems every time I buy a t-shirt from them it has holes in it within a few wears.  The main reason I give them so few stars is that there are never enough people at the register.  There is always a line to check out and usually it is pretty long.  Since there are usually coupons it takes longer for people to check out and it is not uncommon for one person to have multiple transactions.

I didn't  have an appointment so I called and asked if they could fit me in and I was told to come right on over. I get there and was ignored by the two people at the front counter; one was with a customer but the other didn't acknowledge me at all. A girl walked up from behind the wall and asked if I needed anything. I asked for the  \"stylist\" with whom I'd spoken with when I called. After that the service was ok, the \"stylist\" was friendly.  There was a lot of banter back and forth with the staff (it was kind of obnoxious though). I'm all for co-workers getting along and having a good time at work but this was just annoying; yelling across the salon to each other while they could have tried building some report with their clients would have been nice. Maybe, just maybe then I would've gotten what I asked for and showed her (a pic of myself that first time I went there and got the same thing I was asking for this time).\n\nI left unhappy because I was not pleased with how my highlights came out (or didn't come out). In past experiences when I had expressed that I was not happy with the results a couple of stylists  had some reason why the color didn't take and would not try to fix it. I don't like conflict so I decided that I would just go home looking the way I did.  my \"blonde\" highlights were orange, my hair was so dry and it still smelled of products even after several washes. I am a single mom with one income so every penny counts and  it takes a lot for me to go out and spend money on myself. I feel like I've wasted money there. \n\nwell a couple of days go by and I couldn't stand it. I called in and spoke with the Manger Yoli who asked me to come in later that week so that she could take a look at my hair and work with the \"stylist\" and get this fixed for me. So that made me feel better until... I get there at the scheduled time asked for the manager who never came out. The \"stylist\" came out and told me that she wouldn't be ready for at least another half hour (what's the point of setting up an appointment?). \n\nOnce she was ready for me she takes me to her chair and says \"I don't understand what the issue is? I thought you wanted blonde highlights? I mean you're hair is dark so it won't always take.\". I also mentioned how she completely missed a spot that I told her was the main spot I wanted the highlights and her response was \" oh yeah I noticed that when you were here the other day\". (I felt like yelling ARE YOU KIDDING ME? but I didn't.) Not once did she apologize for me not being happy with her work. She just kept bringing up the fact that I have dark hair. She tried to make conversation a couple of times but I really felt like she was annoyed with having to do it over and she was rushing. It was really awkward. I showed her the pictures again and all though out she kept asking to look at it again. I didn't think it was that hard considering I have been there before and to get blonde highlights and got the results I wanted. \n\nI love having dark hair with a few highlights in it so that's what I always ask for. This woman slapped all kinds of bleach on my hair and now my hair looks orangey brown with lighter highlights on it. The colors don't blend well at all and parts of it looks like when its time to get it redone because you see your roots.(it looks like my first attempt to do my own highlights when I was in high school using that plastic cap you pulled your hair through). \n\nNeedless to say I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN! Its too bad the stylist Jeffery that did my hair the first time no longer works there because he was amazing.

First of all I never got the call two days in advance from the photographer even though he said the words \"I called you\" doesn't mean he did.  There was no message left.   Once at the site the photographer was not prepared with any type of ideas for the photoshoot. I brought all of the props that I wanted and I had assumed we would be moving around the park a little bit because they advertised beautiful Azalea Park. All we got was a bunch of bad pictures taken at the meeting spot.   Once I got the pictures back they were horrible! From the lighting to just the quality of the shot being blurry I could have done a better job with my phone.  The glare from their flash was so bad that it just reflected off the clothing and made everything look like one blurred blob.  I called JCPenney's to complain and request a refund on my sitting fee of $24.99 and someone was supposed to get back with me but they did not so I called again about my refund and finally someone called me back but let me know that the fee was non-refundable. I asked them if they had looked at the photos and they said no that they hadn't but that they would and get back with me. At this point no one has gotten back with me.  I went to an amateur photographer and paid $125  for outside shots  and not only did they come  prepared with pose ideas they had actually  went a little early to scan out the location to see where the best places would be to take the pictures  and paid special attention to where the sun was  and was very interested in having my daughter senior pictures turn out great . I guess you get what you pay for  but I assumed being a reputable  company such as JCPenney portraits  I would get the same beautiful photos I get inside  at their outside Studio .  Since this is a new trial  thing I would recommend that they don't go with the outdoor photos because so far they're failing .   Their lack of creativity  and and customer satisfaction is very disappointing. I would not recommend JCPenney outdoor portraits and might just never go to their indoor Studio again since they're more concerned about their $24.99 then they're repeat customers satisfaction.", "date": "2016-11-20 13:04:49"}, {"review_id": "qpiLo54BeeARQYpRe_k2bg", "user_id": "Ql2IhYb0-_onEVkD84iqow", "business_id": "bJGlvnmxdiEHpJgCVx7v1g", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Even though this post is a month overdue, I can't express how pleasantly surprised I was on Black Friday when I received INCREDIBLE service from some of the sales associates at this store - ON BLACK FRIDAY.

She not only sifted through what seemed like hundreds of pairs tossed casually aside outside of the dressing room, she grabbed one of the scanner guns and scanned the pair to see if the store had any remaining in the size I wanted. They had one pair. But it could be anywhere in the store. In a hopeful attempt to find the possible remaining pair, I went to multiple other dressing rooms where the sales associates again sifted through all the pairs at the dressing room.

Getting everyone clean, dressed, fed, napped and happy is quite a task and took a couple of hours of preparation. We got there and the girl seemed clueless. It took her a good 15-20 minutes just to get the background set. Then she told me she had never photographed a baby before and wasn't sure how to pose her. I had to inform her that the baby would need to be held, propped or placed in something. It turns out she didn't know how to pose anyone else either or which props to use. My husband and I had to try to pose everyone which is one of the main reasons why we wanted to have our pictures taken by an experienced photographer instead of taking the pictures ourselves with our cannon. My husband kept requesting that she take additional pictures because he didn't feel we were getting good ones, but she would insist she was getting good ones. It is hard to get a 19 month old to pose and when they do you have to be quick on the trigger, but she was always 10 seconds behind. She also didn't know how to work with kids or try to get their attention. When the kids were over it after about 10 minutes of actual pictures it took her another 20 minutes to upload the photos (which you have to wait for in order to choose the pictures you want and use any coupons you may have). When we finally got to view them there was not one we liked or thought was somewhat decent. Posing was terrible and she obviously didn't know how to work the lighting. She said that she didn't know what to do if we didn't select any pictures and said that she would have to call her manager (she was the only employee there). After waiting another 15-20 minutes for her to talk to her manager on the phone she came back and said that we could just go and the manager would call us the next day. It has now been 3 weeks and guess what? No call from the manager. I haven't bothered calling them because I really don't want to waste any more of my time and I can't think of anything they could do at this point to make it better. I wouldn't want to waste my time going back for a second try. I'm not sure how they vet their photographers but this girl was obviously new and not an experienced photographer. They either need to do additional training or have someone there with her.

As you can see from my profile I'm not a real active Yelper. I'm lazy. So for me to be here typing this right now....it's GOOD:\n\nI was approved online yesterday for a JC Penney credit card and it offered me a special savings for my first purchase. Long story short which led me to have to call customer service is that I (think) I screwed up when I registered for my rewards number, so I couldn't sign into my account properly and I lost my special new card holder discount code. So two problems I was with. And a side note...I avoid calling customer service at all costs...I always use the chat feature if there is one. I generally hate calling the 1-800 number because (no offense) but the representative either doesn't know diddly squat about what I need or how to help me, and/or he/she is so sickeningly sweet with an obvious script that sounds so not genuine....I just can't take it. I'd rather be leveled with. (You don't have to treat me like a robot customer and act like you care about my issue...just be real)....blah blah blah.....bottom line....I avoid calling and prefer to chat. \n\nBut today the chat person didn't know didly squat about what I needed (LMAO - that's funny right?)  I don't know if she cared about my problem or not but she led me to the 1-888 number that led me to ERIN MARTIN - CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CENTURY. \n\nAfter I told her my problem logging in and that I lost my discount code she at first put me on hold for what must've been a while (I was busy computing so I didn't totally notice) but she came back on the phone and TRULY apologized for it taking so long - but it only took the time it did because she was on the other end figuring out exactly how to help me and that's exactly what she proceeded to do.\n\nShe walked me through everything.....telling me to take my time, she was going to stay on the phone to make sure it all worked in the end......And she was like \"tech support\"...she described the screen, etc....She went way beyond any service I've ever received for a lost password and lost coupon code. She explained how the rewards system worked, and she basically answered every single one of my questions so that I literally could check off that problem on my list because this girl took care of it!  Nice! \n\nThen she went on to the coupon code discount and she told me she would need to take my order over the phone so she could manually put in a discount code - - and I was like, OK....so I read her the stuff I wanted....and when we were done she said, very concerned, the stuff you're buying doesn't qualify for this other discount that JCP has going on right now...but she didn't want me to have to pay full price just because I wasn't shopping from the right department...So she asked if she could put me on hold so she could get approval to offer me a personal discount. \n\nMeanwhile, the internet in my house is sucking so bad our connection was jarbled at times a lot.....and just when she put me on hold to go get my discount....BLEEP.....my lovely phone dropped the call. \n\nI was like SHIT! I don't know how to get her back on the phone. It's not like they have their own private lines....and I was like, damn, now I'm not gonna get my special discount....I started to go online to CHAT with someone and ask them if they could find her but then like music to my ears my phone rang and it was ERIN....who took the initiative to look up my number from when I signed up for the account and she called me back!!!!  \n\nIMPRESSIVE\n\nShe proceeded to tell me my discount and then she had to manually enter in the discounted price....and when she was all done, she saved me nearly $50!!!  \n\nI was so excited at how much I saved, I thought, damn, I only get this discount on my first purchase....I should definitely buy more stuff but I haven't looked at everything....\n\nYou'd think the customer service rep, who is expected to do A LOT LESS than this sweet girl was doing for her hourly wage, would just be like, yeah well here's your total..have a nice day....\n\nBUT NOT ERIN\n\nThis was when yelp.com was being typed into my browser:  She said well how about I call you back in an hour or so and you can shop the website more?  \n\nWWWWHHHHATTTT???  SHE'S LIKE THE ANGEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS.....SHE'S SWEET, SHE'S FUNNY, SHE'S VERY DOWN TO EARTH AND REAL, SHE'S HONEST AND SHE'S A FREAKIN ROCKSTAR AT MAKING CUSTOMERS HAPPY. \n\nSo here I am.

This is just my opinion of this particular store.  When it comes to customer service (which JCP has emphasized greatly in the past year) polaris is at the bottom. They put very little effort and do the least amount of work possible, but still get away with it.  I have been there many times and they always seem to go out of their to way to avoid work.  When I go to the Tuttle Crossing store they are always willing to check and call another store for an item.  They go above and beyond.  However, Polaris will tell you an item is in stock at another store but will not call and verify the inventory is correct.  Also, I have been at the Tuttle location and they willingly called Polaris to check on an item.  After waiting for almost a half hour because the four assoicates she talked to hung up \"accidentally\", were too \"busy\" and \"forgot\" (this was a tuesday afternoon, mind you) they finally \"looked\" and said they didn't have it.  Since I live near Polaris I decided to go there myself later that day and check, sure enough they had it...infact, they had two!  \nAll in all, if you want a good shopping experience go to the JCPenney's at Tuttle Crossing.

We had a number of thongs that had been going on so,this was the first opportunity to get to the store to receive credit back into the JC Penny card. I went into the store with three shirts and the clerk took all three shirts and looked up the transaction and gave me a receipt, as I was walking to go out to my car I looked at the receipt and noticed that there was credit for two shirts and not the third shirt. I went directly back to the counter and ask the clerk why were there only credit for two shirts and not the third. She looked on the computer and said\" that there was credit for the third shirt, but she had no ideal how that happen\". She keep the shirt not returning it back to me. I went out to the parking lot and ask my husband about the order, in which he would have had to be put in a wheel chair to come into the store, so I went back into the store to ask for the third shirt back. The line was long and I waited in line like everyone else, once I got to the counter their was a new person at the counter and the young lady that had done the original traction had left from the area. I get to the counter and tell the young lady about the issue with the shirt she stated \"that she did not know how to look online sells and the numbers off the ideas\". Another clerk  cut in to help, but claim the same problem, that she had no way to know what shirt was the free shirt. I stated to her that the first young lady looked up the order when I returned and questioned the amount of refund of a original purchase of a total of one hundred and eight dollars and some old cents. She only had a credit of sixty two dollars on the receipt and told that it added up to the amount, I showed her that three twenty seven dollars do add up to sixty two dollars. I was due back on e of the three shirts. The young lady into called for a manger. I waited for a while on the manger to come and help handle the manner. One the manger get there, \"she ask who was the person\", she seen me and tells the clerk \" put her to the side away from the counter\", I moved back some away from the counter, as she began doing other and than talk to the worker about the issue as if I was not there. I than  was addressed by the manger, with the \"statement, if you what the third shirt back you have to pay twenty seven dollars for it\". I explained to her that my husband had several issues with the online service and they had given the shirt for free and had credit his account. The manger in turn tells me that I returned the shirt and would have to pay twenty seven dollars to get it back. I told her that I would be more than willing to pay the difference for the shirt and she again tell me that I have to pay for the free shirt. The manger than calls the online  service and the tell her that the shirt was given free from a promotion and she was not happy about that and I than talked to the online service there in the store, the man tells me that the shirt was free with promotion. As I was on the phone with him she states, \"you have to pay for the shirt \", and I again tell the man that she has the shirt and will not return it to me. I was still on the phone with the on line service and the manger out loud in the store and in front of customers and staff say\" you are stealing and that is stealing from the store\", I said no you are stealing from me, you have the shirt that I received for free and not willing to return it to me and resell it in the store and get the money from my shirt. The manger than yell again\" you are stealing\" and pick up one of the shirts and throw it at me from across the counter in front of everybody in the store saying,\" you take the shirt. I left the store very upset about the way the whole issues was handle and for to say that I was stealing and than throw a shirt at me was very unprofessional and very discouraging to return to that store with customers service like that.

On a whim, I decided to have the \"Master designer\" at JCP - who cut and colored my hair 2 at the same salon months prior - dye the underneath of my hair to a dark color (think Christina Applegate).\nPregnant and distracted, she mixed black dye into the chestnut brown dye that I requested and foiled it all the way up my head. \nI was confused and thought maybe she'd grabbed a bowl of bleach and was highlighting the top. However; I went into a panic when I turned to see what she was slapping onto the foils. I hoped the bleach had oxidized and asked \"That's the blond color, right?\" When I heard \"Oops! No, it's the black. I can bleach it out tomorrow if you don't like it\". \"Black?! What do you mean by 'black'?!\" \nIt was all downhill from there...\nIn the end, my long, blond hair was zebra striped. Literally. She had done foils across the sides of my head, so when I pulled my hair into a ponytail, I had stripes. \nIn shock, I paid and left. It was closing time and there was nothing that could be done until the next day anyway. I have no idea why I paid, considering I had a photo in my hand of what I actually wanted - which I could show to the manager. It's one of those weird predicaments when you feel like you're stealing if you don't pay - but the service you received was nothing in the world what you wanted. \nThat night, I washed my hair 3 times, trying to rinse some of the black out. The next day, I called in sick, then called the salon to talk to the manager. \nNot only would the manager not give me my money back, she insisted that the only thing she could do for me is have that same stylist bleach the black dye out of my hair; warning that it'd be \"very damaged\". I was all \"Are you crazy?! Do you think I would ever let her touch it again?! I will let you fix it\". To that she replied, \"No. How will she learn otherwise?\" I didn't know and I didn't care. I just wanted my money back so I could pay someone else to fix the mess the stylist at JCP had made. Not that I got what I wanted. \nThe bright side is that the manager at Supercuts was able to somewhat fix my hair. It wasn't back to blond, but she meticulously bleached very small strands so that I no longer had zebra stripes and not all my hair would be damaged. It was more of a all-over brown, but that was better than the \"Elvira\" look I'd left JCP with. The Supercuts manager also felt so bad for me that she only charged me for one color, instead of the 2 blond shades she used, and only charged me for coloring my crown instead of charging me for all-over color (which she did). \nI never went back to JCP - because they refused to have someone less \"distracted\" fix my hair.

I've never even had a Dr. that had me come back to see how my contacts fit after I've gotten a pair! \n\nAnd, she asked me, with my poor vision, if I ever thought of elective cataract surgery. I never even knew that you could elect to have the surgery - however, it's at your own expense, insurance won't cover it if it's elective.\n\nAnd, to top if off, she is having me get my old Rx from another Optometrist (I won't even go into THAT experience!).

The prospect of being a Dad definitely had appeal, but there were certain tasks that come with that great responsibility of fatherhood that I honestly wanted no part of.  And on Sunday, November 21st at 11:30 AM I officially endured one of them:\n\nThe JC Penny's Portrait Studio.\n\nI'll admit it, I had a bad feeling about this from the get-go.  But the plan to capture the Lil' Dictator permanently on Kodachrome quickly went from bad to \"oh my God I think I might actually end up hurting myself or somebody else with a blunt object\" when we arrived for our appointment to discover a lobby crammed full of preening parents and their dressed up snot nosed, out of control spawns.\n\nIt was if Little Miss Sunshine met the Walking Dead.\n\nSeeing this mass amalgamation of kids, parents, strollers, diaper bags, grandparents, snacks and runny noses in such a small confined space before noon and without having had the benefit of an adult beverage to calm my nerves nearly sent me into a state of immediate panic.  It was all the TLB could do to keep me from turning tail and fleeing with the boy child to the relative safety of the Food Court.\n\nBut I didn't.  There were pictures to be taken God dammit, moments to be cherished, and most importantly Christmas presents for the grandparents to be made.  I was going to have to grin and bear it.  Now if only the Lil' Dictator would do the same.\n\nSo we tried to make our way to the front counter, but were nearly knocked over by an overly eager Grandma frothing at the mouth to purchase overpriced images of her inbred looking 3 year old grandchild.  When we eventually made it to the front, we were met by an anorexic looking emo girl with a hair-don't that looked like it was a cross pollinated mash up from Elvira and the boys from Poison.  \n\nShe seemed as if she wasn't all there that day as she gave us a blank deer in the headlights stare when asked the very simple question of how long the wait would be until it was our turn.  Eventually we coaxed an answer from her:  20 minutes.  Even with our appointment.\n\nOh and, honey, a word of advice... you might want to take a few less blue Mercedes at the rave the night before work if you want to function the next day.  Trust me.  I've been there.   It isn't any fun.\n\nSo we made our way to the waiting area, where I studied the assembled families who had seemingly put a lot of importance on this yearly picture taking experience.  Some had come for a group picture with the entire family, some had just that one little spoiled precious, while other breeders had multiple children they wished to take pictures of for this wonderful season of sharing.  \n\nAnd sadly, most of you reading this review will be the recipients of these pictures, in the form of those dreaded happy holiday cards or family newsletters from relatives unknown, updating you on their status while putting a positive spin on Bob's dead end job search, Jenny's failed marriage, Peter's addiction to hookers, and Jan's eating disorder, while wishing you and yours the most happy of holiday seasons.\n\nAnd a quick note to parents, who are you trying to kid?  Darling Billy's hair might be perfectly parted down the middle, and little Susie might have oh so cute curly pink ribbons billowing in her flawlessly curled hair, and they might both be sporting Sunday's best while serving up smiles Rambling Rod would be proud of. \n\nBut you can't fool us.  \n\nWe see the fear in their eyes.  We recognize the hollow expression of dread that comes from Mom losing her cool in the minivan and threatening to cancel X-mas, birthdays and puberty if they even think about ruining this opportunity to prove to the in-laws that they are a perfectly happy and normal family....and GOD Dammit, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MESS THIS UP FOR ME THIS TIME!!!\n\nYou wish to appear as the perfect family, but your kids are no different than everybody else's.  They are all bugger eating, hyper active, conniving little brats that are only being good and smiling at the camera because they have to.  They want to live to see another Christmas.\n\nSo as I'm pondering these thoughts our time finally arrives and to be honest, it went a lot smoother than I ever thought possible.  The photographer was quick, professional and somehow managed to capture a few fetching images of the Lil' Dictator that will unfortunately be making their way onto a Season's Greetings card from the Listers.  That's right.  We are now one of them.\n\nBut at least my kid is different.  He's perfect because he isn't somebody else's kid.  He's mine.", "date": "2010-11-24 19:26:37"}, {"review_id": "eFWGlTxsyuBWygSBhxRdzA", "user_id": "vjvC5Gd0sWGSnpxfaUOvJQ", "business_id": "ASxblW1wy31w_iJD3t0aog", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Absolutely agree with a one star rating.

First the young man at the register didn't know they were on sale or the lady at the next register, then he called to another department, where they also didn't know anything and he was going to refuse to give me the advertised price.  So I asked to speak to the manager.  Fortunately, someone in charge walked up and said that I was right.

Hence, my review of JCPenney.  The prices here are definitely budget friendly, but despite repeated visits, I rarely end up buying much here, as I find much of their men's fashions way too juvenile or, at the opposite end of the spectrum, too old mannish.  And for the stuff I do like, I know I can get very similar merchandise of identical quality off the clearance racks at Kohl's for way less money.  What I do like JCP for is basics like solid color polos, socks, underwear, etc. and to poke around the home section for deals on sheets, towels, and kitchen stuff.  They've also got a pretty decent men's big and tall section, too, with prices way more reasonable than at a specialty store like Casual Male XL.   \n\nOne minor complaint about this store is that it's too damn hot in here!

I have actually had him a couple years in a row and once at the Barton Springs location too. He is the BEST! \n\nHere is what I don't like... the turnover rate here is high. They seem to have new photographers often, so sometimes it can be hit or miss. Due to the lack of experience this can cause them to get behind on their appointments through the day so sometimes you might end up waiting a bit. This can also be due to the fact that they are understaffed too. Many times there is only one person working, which means that one person is taking pictures, setting up the studio, helping customers as they walk up, editing pictures and helping customers make their selections at the computer. That is a lot for one person if they are booked solid with appointments. \n\nI have been coming to JCPenney Portrait Studio for the past 6 years and why do I keep coming back if there are so many things I don't like? It's because of the price and convenience. For me it outweighs the inexperience and all the other bad. This year I went in on a Sunday afternoon with my husband and new baby. We arrived 10 minutes before our appointment time and had to wait over an hour past the scheduled time. It was frustrating especially since I had a 4 month old.

Sara quickly greeted us. As soon as we told her that we needed to return two items (we had the receipt) her demeanor changed. She explained that because Sephora Kiosk Inside JC Penny uses a different coding, it be best if we went to the mall Sephora main store \"just down the hall\". The main Sephora store was located clearly all the way on the other side of the mall; ugh! We explained to the Mall Sephora store sales rep the situation and she explained to us that the JC Penny - Sephora kiosk sales rep did not tell the truth; they could in fact have helped us return the items and refund us the money. She continued to explain that the reason why Sara (Kiosk sales rep) sent us to the main store (over 100 folks have complained about this recently) is because JC Penny does not like to do refunds because it shows on the accounting side as a negative income for the store. In other words, sales reps in the JC Penny - Sephora Kiosk are encouraged to send customers to the Main store to prevent this negative transaction. I don't know how true this is but when I spoke to one of the JC Penny  managers , Tonya, she apologized for the experience and assured us that she would address this with their staff, that this is unacceptable practice. Tonya was very graceful. Sadly, Sara, the Sales rep when approached after we returned the items, basically told us that she didn't care if we talked to the manager, denied everything, and continued to attend another customer, which by the way, Sara was telling the other customer our situation.

The first time I used the lifetime care plan was to simply get the ring cleaned and the prongs checked to make sure the Integrity of the ring was still in tact. It took over 4 weeks. On April 3, 2018 I took my ring in to be sized and have a small diamond replaced that was missing. 5 weeks went by and I heard nothing so I stopped in only to find out they had the wrong phone number on their work order. I was told they cleaned the ring but they couldn't fix the stone \"because it cost more to fix than the ring was WORTH\". That made absolutely NO sense since the stone was a tiny chip which was already on the ring when purchased along with a LIFETIME CARE PLAN. I argued with the sales associate for several minutes before the manager was called over. What they were trying to tell me was it would cost MORE to fix the ring than the ring was WORTH. How on earth could that be and what difference does it make when there was a LIFETIME CARE PLAN THAT COVERS THINGS SUCH AS THIS. After arguing with the manager, she offered me a credit toward another ring purchase, or a refund on the purchase price. That was NOT an option since this was a gift from my daughter. After probably 20 minutes, Shannon agreed to take care of fixing the ring at no cost. My daughter is getting married in June and it was important I have my ring for her wedding. Shannon assured me this would happen. This was May 6. I received a call from Shannon on May 23 telling me the jeweler would replace the stone for the cost of $25.00. That was MY responsibility, not JC Penney's. Again, this was unacceptable! She assured me my ring would be fixed at no charge and now they want me to pay for the stone. Now it's not what the ring is worth, but what my daughter PAID for the ring. Shannon said because she only paid $40. For it on a really good sale, they couldn't fix it because it was going to cost $47.00\nWhy should what a person pays matter over what the item is worth? Plus, as I've mentioned, an extra cost for a LIFETIME CARE PLAN which includes replacing missing stones. After threatening going to social media with this, Shannon finally agreed to fix the ring but it would be the last time anything was to be done on the ring. \nI urge you ALL to think twice about purchasing jewelry from this store and for goodness sake don't pay extra for a useless LIFETIME CARE PLAN.

I hadn't been at a JCP for years, so I was interested to see what it would be like.  \n\nI thought their store was clean and organized, and the staff downstairs were helpful and kind.  The prices are fantastic, and easy to understand.\n\nI had to bra shop, and I'd rather go to the dentist than bra shop.  So, I took a huge sigh and grabbed a bunch in my size and tried them on.  Miraculously, I found one I loved.  I wanted to see if there was another in the same size/style but a different color.  I couldn't find one, so I went to the service desk to purchase the one I had and to ask about another color.  \n\nUpon walking up to the desk, the two associates (one named Becky, the other I was unable to see their tag) kept talking for around 3-5 minutes, despite seeing me there.  Eventually the ladies stopped talking, and Becky approached me.  I tried to shrug off the annoyance of being ignored and asked if there was another color of my bra in the back.  She said \"Um, I GUESS I can check.\"  She tapped the computer keys a few times and said no.  Her general demeanor was one of annoyance.  I decided at that point to leave the store with my one purchase.\n\nI went online the following day to order the bra from the website.  They had what I wanted, and could ship it for free to the local store.  They also said it would arrive within 4-7 business days.  \n\nTwo weeks later, it was still showing \"pending shipment\" on the website, so I called their 1-800 number to check on it.  The lady I worked with was very nice, and offered to call the store to see what days their trucks arrived to see where it was.  The 1-800 gal then called me back to tell me that the person who they spoke to at the store said \"I don't know when the trucks come in, or when her bra is going to be here.\"\n\nSo... when I heard this, I decided to cancel my store delivery order, and have it delivered to my house instead.  1-800 gal said she could do that and waive my shipping because of the past issue.  Which I had no problem with, obviously.  I left with a great experience... until the next day.\n\nThis morning, I received an automated call stating my bra HAD ARRIVED at the store??!?!?!  \n\nI immediately called the store and asked for a manager.  I was referred to a gal named Janet.  I told her the entire story, and she was SO nice, helpful and empathetic.  She asked lots of clarifying questions to make sure that she understood my concerns and problem correctly.  Not only did she track down my bra, and make sure I wasn't double charged, she is holding it for a bit to make sure that my shipping issues are taken care of.  She made sure to let me know that she would be talking to Becky about my poor customer experience and to use my experience in training her staff.  She also asked for me to come back and give them a try again, and then call her to let her know about my experience. \n\nThis situation had the potential to go very very wrong, and for me to give the store 1 star... but Janet alone saved this experience from going south.  She deserves a promotion or raise or at least a cupcake for great customer service.

Overall, this is the MOST terrible experience I have ever had and that could be an understatement. \n\nIt started back in July when I placed an order for a furniture. A few days later, I received a notice that this order was shipped and my credit card was charged. The estimated shipping date is August, 10th. However, I have never got any update since then. I called the customer service many times and was always told to wait and given different shipping dates. They gave me a number for the delivery company and the people there told me they have no record of the order at all. They also promised to call me back on this order several times but never did.\n\nAfter numerous attempts, one customer representative finally told me that the original order was not appropriately placed (no explanation of why that happened at all). They cancelled the original order and placed another. That is in early September already. Then a new email about shipping date came with charge placed on my credit card again. But the same thing happened again. No update whatsoever since then and I had to contact the customer service again and again for the update.\n\nI finally decided it is not worth any more waiting and want to cancel the order. But the customer service person told me that they cannot do that since they are investigating the problem with the order and they will not refund me until they figure out the reason. They said (again) they will respond in 3 to 5 days. The customer representative also said she will personally investigate this issue and get back to me. But still no communication whatsoever for another two weeks. \n\nNow it is October and I tried online chat with their customer service and they referred me to call (which is always the more time-consuming option). This time, the customer representative told me that they did not even had the item in the first place when the order was placed. \n\nI have placed numerous online orders with many merchants and have never had an experience like this. They just took your money with no update, no follow-up, keep giving excuses and offer no solution at all. They made a lot of promises and gave me many \"estimated\" times needed to resolve the issue but nothing ever happened with them.

Shortly, the needed sizes were unavailable.  Alas, the best laid plans....  Fortunately, on the \"locate in store\", the JCPenny @ Tuttle had both the pants AND jacket (no other JCPenny locations had both).  \n\nI called the Mens department and worked exclusively with an absolutely wonderful woman named Betty.

Upon arriving I waited less that 60 seconds and was immediately in and trying on said suit.  Thankfully, Betty gave some guidance and had the suit altered to fit my athletic frame instead of simply sticking with a boxey run-of-the-mill suit.  The alterations were perfect and she did them very quickly & efficiently.  I was also charged the sale price on the website...VERY NICE; saving a significant amount of money but still getting a high quality, sharp suit for the wedding and beyond.  Betty was the absolute best to deal with, efficient, nice, and the entire process took less than 15-20 minutes.

There is another JC Penney at the Vancouver Mall about 8 miles away; so it makes one wonder when the mall location will be closing.  In order to prepare for the inevitable I decided that I needed some new shirts for work, and with state tax refund in hand, and the Tax Deduction in the other hand, I set off to explore the new store.\n\nHaving rarely been in a Penney's that was not attached to a teenage collective (mall) it was kind of like walking into the entrance of a Target or a Kohls.  I have to admit, it was clean and fresh looking, clearly visable signs gave you a gentle hint as to where to find the object of your desire.  In my case I needed Men's clothes... big mens clothes.... they call it the Big & Tall, I like to give omage to Rodney Dangerfield and I regularly tell the Wife I am off to Thornton Melon's Tall & Fat Store.\n\nIf you are like me (poor bastard) finding clothes that fit with having that \"Omar the Tentmaker: look is always a challenge.  Not all JC Penney's are set up with a good selection like the one at Vancouver Mall, but I was happy to see the new store had the same basic collection.  Further proof that the mall location is probably tanking.\n\nWith the guiding fashion sense of the Tax Deduction I found some nice shirts in nice colors to cover my bulk.  We decided we were ready to check out, so I walked around to the front of the Men's section to look for the checkout kiosk.  Nothing.  Hmmmm, well there was a dressing room, they usually put them there.  Nothing.  Ah-ha, womens dangles and bobbles, there has to be a cashier there.  Nothing.  No employees either.  And I don't mean an empty cashier kiosk, I mean no kiosk at all.  It couldn't be by the front door, I came in that way.  The front entrance was all that was left, so I walked up there and embedded in the walls on either side of the doors was a cashiers area.  Finally I found a living soul with a name tag on, she was three or four people ahead of me in line and working hard to keep up.  Poor girl was caught in the popular corporate game, \"How few people can we run a big box store with?\"\n\nAll in all they had what I needed and eventually I was able to pay for it, so that was good.
