Staff are very friendly, especially one of the guys who is usually working in the fragrance section - always very chatty & funny! They will go out of their way to grab you a sample or two, answer any questions or check stock on a particular item. However it does get insanely busy during the bi-annual VIB sale (1 week in April and November) - I prefer to catch that one online! The store is always well-stocked and I've never been unable to get hold of a particular item. \n\nI prefer going to Sephora over similar beauty stores as they have such a wide range of mid to high-end products including makeup, skincare, haircare, travel products and fragrance. With their Beauty Insider points card you can earn points every time you shop to redeem on a selection of miniature size and exclusive products. And as mentioned, I do spend quite a lot so their points have really paid off for me! \n\nA must-visit if you're in the area, especially if you're travelling and need to stock up on a few essentials or gifts!

However, every single time I come out feeling like a clown. I go to Sephora well because I honestly buy everything from shampoo to moisturizer to perfume from there( I shop there a lot more so online but yeah i'm a little addicted). This store kind of stresses me out because it is crazy busy ALL THE TIME!  It's insane in there, so much so I had to track someone down to let them know I had an appointment at 3 pm( the girl at the cash register kept ignoring me so I figured I would just go stop someone that looked important).  You do need an appointment for a custom makeover(min 50 dollar purchase). It was a little crazy of a start but when Krystal came over it was \"smooth sailing.\" \n\n I let Krystal know how I felt, and she rose to the task!! I told her the one person we needed to please was my mother( think UES new york mother whose nickname I kid you not is \"the queen\" yup it's that serious!) and she LISTENED to everything I said.  When she was done I found myself looking in the mirror over and over again this may seem normal to your typical female these days but I am NOT a selfie type of chick.  I actually had people stop and stare at the end and at least 4 or 5 different women and men stop and say I looked beautiful.  However, the test was my mother who when I walked through the door of my house did not say anything, you may think this is bad but trust me this is as big of a compliment Krystal can get! I even pushed it and asked what she thought and simply she said \" beautiful a million times better then that last time when you looked ridiculous.\" yup love my mum! Krystal was honestly awesome, she was not obnoxious and loud but smart, sweet, and definitely knows what she is doing! Sephora is lucky she picked Orlando to move to from Hawaii!! Make sure she stays there because I will request her each and every time I need my makeup done! \n\noh and let me mention that the line was super long to check out(maybe it had to do with the girl at the cash register that looked like she was hating life and moving at a snails pace, and I couldn't get a job there, hmmm) and I was in a major hurry and she went and found the mobile check out and was able to get me out in less than 5 minutes!

I didn't have much Highhope's because I felt like I had tried everything to cover spots that I got from my birth control that appeared on my face over time of usage and which people love to point out as well as to asking me who hit me and I shouldn't let my man do that to me. Which obviously was very annoying and absolutely not true. I walked in and I ask for some advice from the cosmetology lady. Her name was Natasha she was from my island in Puerto Rico so we started talking and I explained to her what was going on and she couldn't believe how rude people could be saying that. It also made her upset that people would think that. I told her why I have them and how I have been trying to get rid of them but I was just fed up and I needed a change and I needed to make myself feel more confident and feel better. She started taking off my old makeup and told that that was not the right color for me that the lighter it was it was going to show more of the spots that I had. So she started recommending and putting it on for I could see the difference on one side of my face to the other as she finished putting on the makeup I looked in the mirror and I was happy I said to her this is the girl I remember and I started to tear up. She started saying don't cry, don't cry! If you cry you're going to pay double LOL she was really nice, very supportive and she made me feel comfortable. At the end of my purchase which I got Smashbox which I recommend this brand she kept looking at me and she said: you're like a totally different person; you look amazing so I would recommend if you have any doubts or questions on makeup go up to the ladies and ask. You never know if you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Natasha was fabulous this was at millennia mall but they do move them from store to store but she was amazing thank you for making me feel better about myself and that there was a solution while I kept trying to resolve my challenges.

What to do?  After researching several allergy friendly product lines on the internet, we printed out a list and came to Sephora.  Due to Mom's allergies, she couldn't even enter the store because of the perfumes and other scents within--she was asthmatic within moments.  So she went back out onto the mall while I went in.  \n\nRoxi greeted me and I explained the situation, handing her a list of some of the products I had found online.  She graciously removed her brush belt and other gear that she couldn't take out of the store and queried my mother on her preferences.  We went back and forth into and out of the store while Roxi sampled various concealers, blushes, lipsticks and eye shadows and brought them out to Mom to test them for her skin type and preferences.  In a short time we had gathered all the products that we needed--including a few alternates--and all without endangering Mom's fragile health.  At no time did Roxi try to upsell me on anything, and she knew the ins and outs of each of the three or four product lines I had selected so that we could mix and match at will.  She advised me of the store's return policy as well.  When I inquired about makeup palettes she said that the store had recently discontinued them and offered an acceptable work-around.  Additionally to speed things along, Roxi arranged for me to check out using their online credit card gadget with another equally courteous gentleman representative so I wouldn't have to wait in line at the register.  The customer service here is top drawer!  \n\nSephora seems to have every cosmetic and signature scent in abundance, in an efficient, compact space that nevertheless has a lot of room to move about.  The extremely clean and well-lit store is thoughtfully laid out and everything is accessible, with plenty of testers and applicators close at hand.  Mirrors everywhere of course.  Even though I'm male and don't wear makeup, I've seen the department store competition and usually powder and product smears are everywhere, spills are commonplace and glass/chrome is not well maintained.  Sephora is spotless.  \n\nThe only downside?  Prices are high--no doubt due to the high-end specialty product they carry--so if you're on a budget be careful and plan ahead if possible.  I was not and didn't and we'll likely return what she doesn't use for the wedding...we could buy a LOT of groceries with the proceeds.  But I don't have to worry about loading anyone into an ambulance, so it balances pretty well.  The products she wore to test with didn't cause any allergic reactions, so I can attest to their safety.  Good stuff sold here.  \n\nSephora clientele is pretty attractive as well.  Not sure if they were checking me out or just looking to see if I noticed them, but it's a fun place to people watch.  And this was around 1PM on a Tuesday.  \n\nHighly recommended, even if you have severe allergies and can't go into the store!  Just be sure to bring a wing(wo)man to assist and they'll take care of you.  Customer service is BACK.

I was intrigued, and of course an employee came over to see if I had questions and asked if I wanted to match to my face color. I told her I was not sure because I was not too comfortable with the almost $40 price tag for foundation. Still, I talked to the apparently \"benefit rep\" about the foundation, and when I told her about my budget she looked at me like some dirty peasant. So I left that side of the store to go purchase my almost $40 powder.

She led me to another lady who started making me a sample. This lady began to tell me my skin was basically garbage (in a very rude way) and had no personality what so ever. I could tell she did not want to make me a sample. My younger sister (only 11) bought a benefit concealer, and I asked if she could show my sister how to better apply to cover her acne. \n\nWe came back later because they were doing a promotion for benefit cosmetics, and my sister really wanted to spin the wheel they had going.

I will never step foot into this Sephora again. My son and I came into the store about 2 weeks ago, for my first Sephora \"experience\". I came in to find a good foundation,  and an eye shadow palette that ulta had sold out of. I found my things, and while paying I noticed they sold glam glow masks. I mentioned it to the cashier, who was extremely nice. And she said \"get a sample girl, I'll call someone over to help you.\" My son and I waited 15mins. For a sample. No, I'm not exaggerating and the only reason I know is because my fianc\u00e9 had called right when we walked over to the glam glow. But, that's not what bothered me. I saw they had a sample pack for $40ish to try out the different masks, and was going to buy it and skip the sample. The shelf was out. They have drawers. I opened the drawer to see if they had one, and they didn't. My son said \"mommy maybe it's in this one?!\" The woman who was \"getting my sample\" comes around the corner and yelled at my son for opening the drawer. And told him (my 5 year old son) \"Uh customers don't open the drawers thanks.\" Maybe I'm crazy, but one you shouldn't be yelling at a customer no matter their age and two if customers can't open the drawers why aren't they locked? And three, in his mother and I will discipline as I feel necessary. He was being kind, and helping me look for an item. He was being extremely well behaved and sweet trying to help his mom out. I am a manager at another retail establishment that has \"understock\" drawers and customers are more than welcome to open them. And I would never yell at a child for opening a drawer..I left, and called corporate. That was the next lovely experience. The girl I got on the phone didn't apologize one time. I didn't expect a gift card, or points or anything. All I wanted was \"I'm sorry that happened to you\" I didn't get that at all. When I said I thought it was ridiculous that when a customer complains about a bad experience she didn't apologize for the experience, I thought it was rude. She then says, \"well, I added points to your account but I guess now I'll take them away.\" Are you kidding? Are these people not trained on providing customer service or what?

So I went. The entrance was nice, there were small smoothie samples and chocolate (Andes mints). There were also name tags. Ummmm. They had it set up like you were going into some sleek club, I guess. I don't go to clubs (especially the sleek ones) but it's what I picture in my mind. Anyway.\n\nThe store seemed staffed more highly than usual but still not enough. I went in with one thing I definitely wanted to get (make up forever e/s #92) and an idea of something else I wanted (liquid foundation, normal skin, non-transferrable, cruelty free, in a nice package, not something that would spill or come out too fast, that wasn't the most expensive thing Sephora carries). I kind of hoped I could sit in the chair and have a little makeover done! I thought there'd be swatches of many products and we'd have an experience of making a perfect match for me. \n\nI had a sales associate help me with the foundation and we also talked about undereye concealers. We walked around to a few different areas but no chair! I got the foundation suggested which was pricey ($36?). I put the concealer in my basket but as I walked around, I thought to myself, \"$24 for that? That's stupid.\" So I put it back. I found a concealer on my own for $6 less. That's a bowl of pho! Sephora has a great return policy. If you don't like it, bring it back. So if the one I chose sucks, I'll take it back.  \n\nThe sales associate was pretty slick. She told me how nice my skin was (it's alright, I guess...) and was extra friendly greasing my palm, \"Oh you're so easy to put makeup on....\" it reminded me of the Raisins waitresses from the South Park episode about Hooters. \"All the other guys here are SO LAME but you seem really cool!\" But to be fair, she also took what info I gave her and made a match. She used info about the lines I already like (Philosophy, Fresh) and didn't suggest something like Dior that isn't in line with those ethics models. I probably would have never looked at Tarte (what I purchased) without her suggestion. \n\nThe place was pretty busy, there were lines. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes for fragrance samples and ended up just putting four large bottles in my basket to get samples when I was paying. I was pleased, at least, that the sales associate apologized. I apologized for bringing 4 giant bottles up to the register but explained I waited and waited and no one ever came through fragrance. She seemed genuinely apologetic. Maybe just more palm-greasing. But I felt like it was genuine. \n\nI successfully avoided buying any fragrance. A major feat for me. Especially with a coupon!\n\nI was disappointed with the selection of seasonal stuff. I didn't feel like I saw anything that wowed me or didn't feel recycled. Everything felt old. I looked at my \"menu\" (their word) when I left and all the \"specials\" were with the 20% discount, on Sephora brand products. So I feel like this event was a push for Sephora branded items, not the high end stuff. \n\nThere were a lot of smart coupon moves being made. While in line, I saw moms and daughters (buying, in bulk, the largest Clinique moisturizer, with discount!), a girl who had one big bottle of Juicy Couture (20% off is probably cheaper than you can get it online for an authentic product). \n\nI kind of went for things I had been eyeing for awhile and just needed a little excuse. I just picked up a liquid foundation (Tarte Smooth Operator), concealer for dark circles (Make Up Forever HD), that eyeshadow, (#92) an empty DIY rollerball (I've wanted one forever, they're $10, refillable with anything you own!) and a small shower gel for $5. I didn't really get buck-wild but I dropped a bit. \n\nCashwrap was a little bit of a letdown. The wait was kind of long. People were impatient. They were out of their promotional item (a reusable Sephora bag/tote) but I got four fragrance samples (and I love that they never give you any shit about asking for samples, it's like you're expected to ask for samples) and they were handing out these cute little sample bags that had Sephora lip gloss and about 5 high end samples. I love samples. \n\nWould I go again? Probably not.

I came about 15 minutes early for my appointment, but Lauren was able to get me started 4 minutes early. \nShe did a terrific job. She really, really knows her stuff, and makeup application was pretty flawless. I had a decent idea of what I wanted for my prom look (dark lip, contour), and I let Lauren take the rest into her own hands. Eyeshadow was great (she used a neutral palette), using mostly dark brown and gold to match my dress. I asked for a small winged eyeliner. She did a neat wing which was longer than I wanted, and she was able to fix it and make the line much shorter without affecting the eyeshadow underneath, which to me is more impressive than getting it right the first time! I didn't have to worry about choosing false eyelashes (which I know nothing about). She chose her favorite pair, applied them, and they looked wonderful. Foundation application was great, contour was great, and Lauren did quite a bit of highlight. I normally don't do that much highlight, but it came out beautifully for pictures, so she was definitely on point for that one. She applied red matte liquid lipstick (scary, right?) like a pro. Before the actual makeover started she went through different shades with me patiently to find the perfect red.\nAnd she did this all while being extremely nice, professional, and easy to communicate with. She was super focused the entire time, which made me feel comfortable in her hands. \nAfterwards, she we were all very happy with the look. I think she was the most excited, actually, which just goes to show how invested the artists are here. Throughout my makeover other sephora workers were coming up and asking about the makeover, prom, etc. They were very, very nice, and afterwards everyone there was excited about my makeup (I don't know their names, but there were at least 3 other workers there who were really nice). \nI think my makeover was over an hour long (I had scheduled a 45 minute one). I'm guessing if you schedule a 45 minute appointment you will normally get that amount of time, but this goes to show how thorough Lauren was.\nI could have just been lucky with the set of workers I got on that day, but I had gone during the week prior to look at lip colors, and the entirely different set workers then were very nice in showing me around and even complimenting my lip color.\nI was initially nervous about prom day, but I had a wonderful experience here.

If you are new to makeup or want to learn all about applying correctly by the Sephora experts, I HIGHLY recommend checking out their list of free classes listed on the main website. You only need to sign up to be a Sephora Beauty insider (if you aren't already)  to reserve your spot for the class. \n\nThe classes vary in topic. I attended a class focusing on contouring and highlighting since I had not a clue how to do and had always been interested in learning . The class was on a Sunday from 9a-1045a(before store hours). I recommend parking at the back of the mall close to the food court entrance. Also, for this particular class, they suggest wearing foundation prior to attending since you will essentially be using your face as a palette for practice.   When we arrived, we were greeted by employees who checked us all in then ushered us towards the back of the store where a long table was set up with mirrors, massive makeup brush sets (need to add this to next year's Christmas list!) and various shades of concealer, contour sets, blushes and shimmer powders for our use. I highly recommend arriving together with your friends( and early) so you are seated together.  I loved the handouts provided that were available to take notes and to list products used (genius idea to generate sales).  What I loved even more is that the instructor Caitlin (hope I spelled correctly) demonstrated the techniques on a fellow employee and then we were each invited to try out on ourselves. It was a little intimidating at first but everyone working was super helpful and encouraging(Shoutout to Robbie and Cindy!). The class ended earlier than scheduled so we were invited to shop if we wanted. \n\nCindy helped me find some of the items I was interested in purchasing . When I mentioned that I was looking for a foundation, she recommended the Color IQ service and said that based on the results it would pinpoint what products in store that would work best for my skin tone.  I was even able to email the list to myself for future reference.  When I decided on a product, Cindy was nice enough to apply and touch up my makeup.   \n\nI had such a fantastic experience and now I don't feel as nervous and intimidated about shopping here as I had been previously.

She did leave and go to get some coffee.  I went to Jason's Deli and one of the employees was nice enough to call mall security.  I was informed to enter through the food court! That was my first thought! I zoomed to the food court and entered the mall! I could hear the echo of young, female, laughter through the empty mall but I did not see a line.  I yelled out to the girl who was now following closely behind, I hear them but I don't see a line! When we got closer to the store it was only about 10 people waiting.  I was so hyped to be one of the first few in line!  We watched as over the next 90 minutes the line got longer and longer and people arrived to the mall to open the stores.  At 9:00 the Sephora employees exited the store with a large red ribbon and spelled S-E-P-H-O-R-A and yelled very loudly.  After the short ribbon cutting ceremony the woman started passing out the cards.  I would have preferred to be able to reach into a basket and and pick my own card.  It turns out I was the the last of the first few to get a $10 card! I think the first few people should have at least received $25! The two behind me received $50 and someone near the middle of the line was the first to get $100! The store was packed full of people! Everything was clean (because it was new!) and it was nice to see so many employees eager to help the happy shoppers! The store was too crowded as with most grand openings so I did not purchase anything. The store is on the smaller side for a Sephora but it is nice to have a one in between Buckhead and Perimeter.

I asked one of the girls if I could get my color matched,and she just kind of looked at me and was like \"well what kind of foundation do you use now\" and I told her, then she just kept asking me about if I liked my foundation and then I realized she had no clue what I was talking about so I pointed to the color IQ thing and was like \" nooo I meant if I could see what my skin color IQ was\" and then she proceeded to tell me that she would have to take off all my makeup and that it's not 100% accurate and then they would have to moisturize me then re do all my makeup...

After the holidays I decided to go on a little shopping spree with my friend. As we go into the store we separated since we have different likes with make up. I went over to one of the aisles to look and see what was on the shelf. As I'm looking I felt a presence of being watched. I kinda turned my head over my shoulder and saw an older woman with long gray hair intensely\nWatching me. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just me assuming and jumping to conclusion so I started to walk up each aisle and then turning the corner to go down another one and sure enough this woman followed me down each aisle. It made me feel very uncomfortable and like I could not shop in peace. I decided to go to the perfume section. As I was looking through the perfumes, I looked over and there was this woman again standing in the corner between the perfumes and the face creams. Watching. Didn't even say \"how are you\" or \"do you need some help\" just stood and watched and made me feel like I was being profiled as a criminal or something. \n\nNow this brings me to today when I went to this same location to pick up this perfume I had been wanting. As I go over to the perfume it seems like everything is going fine and maybe the last experience was a fluke, however when I went to the middle stand of the rollerballs I looked up and saw two employees standing 3 feet away from me watching me and not saying anything. I got very frustrated at this point that once again i was being looked at as if I was doing something shady. And yes one of the two women was the women with gray long hair. After all of this experience I will NOT return to this location. I will not be made to feel that way by people who are suppose to be helpful and pleasant when you walk in, but instead they make you feel as if your trying to rob the place.

And this after I say, 'I just want something natural looking that brings out my eyes a bit.'\n\nNow I know that Sephora is not a beauty salon, so doesn't deserve to be judged on its makeup artists (I hear you thinking it!)... but I do think that if they're going to offer these free makeovers to demonstrate the quality of their products, that they should get some 'demonstrators' who actually know what they're doing.

I was expecting to see some luxury brands because it's the Domain: Armani, Burberry, and Tom Ford (Tom Ford is new to Sephora generally so I was really hoping to see it) are all missing, as well as some Stila which is usually a staple everywhere. They had a few isles of products sectioned off (masks, serums, moisturizers) which took up more space than what is necessary. It's nice to have, but every Sephora does that on a more condensed scale which achieves the same function but allows for more brand space. \n\nSince it's a grand opening weekend they were heavily staffed, borrowing from other stores and heavy vendor support, so the customer service was overwhelming. It'll calm down and I'm confident that it will remain consistently good as all Sephoras are great with customer service. \n\nOverall, it's a great location and this will be probably end up as the one I visit the most.

Okay and yes, if there are some lapses in my Marxist ideology, those come in the form of cosmetics consumption. \n\nIn Chicago, I always shopped at Ulta, but I'm pretty sure there is no Ulta in Columbus.

ANYWAY. \n\nI drove to Polaris today, something I put off as long as possible because malls skeeve me the hell out, because I needed perfume and foundation, and ended up having an interesting experience. Since it's summer, my foundation tone changed (cuz I spend time outside... something I'm surprised more of my friends don't actually do, BOO!) and so I asked one of the sales people for help. I picked said salesperson because she was young and tattooed and it's nice to have a fellow freak help ya at a very normative store, you know?

I tried to explain that to her and simply asked if she could issue me a sephora gift card with that balance but she just repeated \"sorry, theres just really nothing else I can do for you\".

Clouds your ability to think reasonably?  . . . Makes the heart go pitter patter?  \n\nLove?. . .  Better. . . .Sephora.  \n\nOh Sephora, where do I start?  My first experience was about 5 years ago for my wedding.  Since I was getting married abroad (Key West is abroad, right?) I wanted to do my own makeup but needed to get some help and some new products.  I went into sephora and had my makeup done, purchasing all the products and brushes they used.  I learned techniques that I had never heard of or considered before. (Learning to apply dark eyeshadow with an eyeliner brush literally changed my life.)  The cost was about $250 for everything but many of the products lasted quite a bit of time.  In fact, several months ago my rust Stila eyeshadow finally ran out and I realized that the eyeshadow lasted longer than my 2 year marriage did.  \n\nSpeaks volumes about the quality of Stila products OR my inability to pick a life partner? You decide. \n\nThe best part about Sephora is you can try EVERYTHING on at these little makeup stations.  There is no excuse to leave with something you do not love.  The sales people are always extremely helpful, although sometimes seem to push products that are outside of my budget.  I don't care if that $84 lotion will make me feel *energized,* unless it also heats my house for 60 days, it's not going to happen sista.  \n\nAlthough I cannot say enough good things about Sephora, I offer you this disclaimer: Because everything is so magical and expensive, your perception can become dangerously skewed.  After spending 30 minutes looking at blushes that cost $30-$40, you can suddenly find one that costs $24 and you think you've hit the jackpot.  No matter what, remember chapstick should not cost $13. Bobby pins should not cost $11. Do not let the spell of Sephora fool you into thinking you had stumbled upon the makeup equivalent of a sample sale.  Always know what you want to spend before you enter the store and stick to your budget.  \n\nI have walked out of Sephora, too many times, with an itty bitty eensy teensy tiny bag and an inability to pay my car payment.

I live and work between 2 other Sephoras, but couldn't let that stop me from visiting this new outpost. \n\n- It's situated outside of Ponce City Market (PCM) with nearby short term parking (free spots!), so it's great for quick drop-ins (i.e., new lippie for date night). If you're going to PCM just for Sephora, I recommend entering the parking lot on the back side near Dancing Goats. You'll see Sephora on the left. If you entering off Ponce (with the market on your left), Sephora will be a bit hidden, but it's straight ahead, adjacent to the cycle studio and parking deck. \n\n- This location is smaller than the Lenox flagship; maybe around the size of Perimeter, I can't be certain. Because it's smaller (and new), you likely won't find all the brands you would at Lenox or the more established locations. For instance, one of my fave brands, REN, isn't stocked. That's to be expected. More SKUs will likely be added as they figure out demand. Be sure to ask the manager about missing brands so it's on their radar. \n\n- If you're used to the other stores, the layout is a bit different. Skincare is in the back on the left. And of course, cosmetics are throughout. If you need to get your skin tone matched, this store is super ideal with all the natural light pouring in. \n\n- The service was the best I've experienced at Sephora in a long while. I'm really hoping that's a mainstay. Every consultant I encountered was knowledgeable and friendly, including the manager. The ladies at checkout were super sweet. While this won't be my staple store (too far), I plan to visit when I can, simply for the cheery service.

My experience started off alright, I walked in and was happily greeted by two employees at the front of the store. It seems that the only friendly people who work at this store are the people who greet you and the people who constantly ask you if you need help when you're just trying to browse. After walking around for a bit I went to the register and asked the woman working, Michelle, if I could return the Caudalie grape spray that I bought. I didn't have the receipt since this was a purchase made during the chaos of the holiday season, so I kindly asked her to look in my Sephora account. This is where my experience went from 0 to 100. Michelle rudely asked me when my purchase was in a tone that I did not appreciate. After working for 8 years in the service industry I could not believe how rude someone could be to a customer. I told her it must have been purchased in December and once she found it she kept arguing with me about the product not matching the one in my order history. There are two kinds of sprays sold at Sephora during the holidays for this particular product, one is on its own and the other in a gift box that apparently has some kind of attachment on the bow that is on the box. I had picked up this gift box while I was in line and it literally only had a spray in the box, nothing else in or outside the box. Michelle started a petty argument with me saying that since I only had the bottle without the box and its attachment I could not return it. I told her that it never came with anything else and I only received the bottle but she decided to start going at it with me over some product I've never seen that is probably less than 1 oz. After 4 rounds of us going back and forth about the product not matching she still did not offer me a solution and she condescendingly said, \"I'm not rejecting your return, but you can't return this.\" OH. REALLY? That's not rejecting my return? I have NEVER had any issues with a return at Sephora in all the years I've been shopping there. Also when did the retail industry start hiring idiots who are not understanding towards their customers, and why is it that a customer is made out to feel like an idiot when this is supposed to be an enjoyable experience? It's not like I was returning a $100 face oil, it was literally a $15 shitty spray that is clearly showing in my order history. She called her manager over who proved to be equally useless but slightly more understanding. I was so pissed after having to defend my argument once again with two clueless people who offered no solutions so I had to walk out. After about 10-15 minutes my friend who was with me and still making a purchase called me and told me the store realized that the shipment they received in December didn't come with the attachment on the Caudalie gift box and I could now do the return. Once I was back in the store the manager was a little nicer since she clearly knew she and Michelle were wrong for arguing with me. While I appreciate the attempt at an apology, a bag of samples is not going to remove the bad taste in my mouth after my interaction with Michelle. I will definitely be rethinking going back to this location. To treat a customer that shops there almost weekly like they are some kind of liar trying to get some free money is unbelievable.

This is an update from my previous review. I dropped by Sephora on a Sunday at 11:00am (the time the store opens). There were quite a few employees gathered in the center of the store catching up with one another. As I walked towards them, not one of them stopped to ask if I needed help. I was hoping to quickly ask someone where a product was located. I didn't plan on asking much more of the employees at Sephora because I am already aware of their poor customer service and unwillingness to help. I tried to make eye contact with one of the employees working there. I caught their eye and they quickly turned around and started talking into their ear piece thingy. THIS EMPLOYEE DID THE EXACT SAME THING TO ME 5 MONTHS AGO! I found where I needed to be myself. Finally, I caught the attention of a different employee. I asked a simple question and found out they did not know the meaning of \"matte\". At this point I told them I was fine and did not need help because that was clearly useless. Additionally, you would think that the store would be organized and well put together since it was 11:00am on the dot and not many had been in the store yet. It was in complete disarray. Nothing was organized and I was really struggling to find the product I needed. Because I have been a loyal Sephora customer since I started wearing makeup (I won't age myself but it has definitely been double digit years ago) I know where the extra stock is located (drawers under display) I had to find the product I was looking for myself (drawer was also a hot mess). idk? Seems like Sephora probably doesn't want me digging around in there but nonetheless. I have had the same problems consistently for quite a few years now. I kept returning because I am a loyal customer and liked to take advantage of my beauty insider status. I will no longer shop at Sephora. I do not want to leave a store with a luxury product after being treated so poorly. The unfortunate thing is I actually spend REAL MONEY at this store.

Based on the other poor reviews here, it looks like someone needs to review their hiring practices.  \n\nThis was the second location I visited yesterday.  I received a 15% off for a foundation and I had been considering buying a new foundation anyway bc it had been a while.  Unfortunately most of the time I buy a foundation the same day I sample it I end up disappointed when I get home.  I'm very pale and have dry skin so they usually end up looking orange or emphasizing the dryness.  For this reason I like to get a few samples, take them home, try them for a few days then pick the one I like best.  \n\nAfter my experience at the first store I thought surely someone here will be more helpful.  However the first person I asked for help snapped at me that she was already helping someone else.  She wasn't standing with anyone so this wasn't apparent but she acted like I was so rude for asking her.  \n\nThen a very sassy man came and begrudgingly asked if I needed help.  When I told him I wasn't sure what shades I needed he picked one tried it and then rushed through getting me the others with out even trying them on my skin to see if they matched.  A girl then came up and he asked her to get another sample for me based on a sample he had picked without testing and she came back with a couple.  He told her to go with the one with yellow undertone bc I had a lot of yellow in my skin.  I don't know much about shades of foundation but I know for sure I do not have yellow undertones.  I'm super fair and part of the problem (which I told him) is I always go home and look orange.  Once he was done bagging the samples he immediately walked away and left the girl to talk to me.  He acted like I was wasting his precious time and he had so many other more important things to do.  The girl who finished answering some of my questions was the only friendly, helpful person I talked to in this store.\n\nSure enough I got home and the only sample he gave me that wasn't too yellow was the one he tried on my skin.  So this unpleasant experience was all for nothing bc I  didn't end up with the samples of the products I was interested in in the shades closest to my skin tone.\n\nHorrible customer service and not even good at his job.

The total was still on my mind, so I decided to pull out the receipt and discovered that the cashier had charged me for a 4th random item that I did not buy! I stepped out to call the store 7 minutes before they closed, and they told me that the cashier must've scanned an item twice. I told them that that wasn't the case and asked if it would be possible to pull up my order and refund me for their mistake over the phone. They told me I would either have to run back to their store immediately (in the middle of my birthday dinner) or drive 50 minutes back to their store tomorrow because my card would have to be inserted in order to issue the refund. I asked them if it'd be possible for me to read my card numbers to then over the phone. They told me that it wouldn't be possible without inserting my card into their machine. \n\nI ran back to their store, IN THE RAIN, IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BIRTHDAY DINNER, to find out that they only needed me to press a green button. The process took 5 SECONDS and the cashier told me MY CARD WASN'T EVEN NEEDED. I wasn't even offered a discount for the inconvenience and came back to my dinner with soaking wet hair. The food had just come out by the time I came back too. \n\nOverall, horrible experience.

Sephora also has its own line of products, from brushes to gift collections, and everything i've tried has been fun and unique. Be careful making your selections, though, because the prices are pretty high (though to be fair, no higher than what the individual companies they sell would charge you). Items that are displayed like checkout-lane candy (mini items, etc) can be a lot pricier than you'd think, so just be aware. But look around- there are some great gift items and product sets that can be a real bargain. Sephora offers pretty gift wrapping, especially around the holidays, for free, so take advantage if you'll be wrapping items anyway!

Some staff know more than others as expected (skincare specialist, makeup specialist etc). Even with new people, I never have a hard time finding an appropriate staff member to give a recommendation. As someone who only really wore clinique and physicians formula (i know what was I thinking...) in HS, beginning to shop in some local boutiques became frustrating as I was having a hard time finding people willing to work with me to find products that I loved. At Sephora they do just this!!!\n\n2) When I'm on the 'hunt' for something, a nude lipstick, a new concealer, a new night moisturizer, I have options, and for creams, you can take home samples to compare how they feel when applying and how it absorbs ect. This is particularly helpful for beauty balms, and foundations. \n\n3) They have the little tool that recommends best shade of foundations for you. Also samples help so you don't drop hundreds finding the right shade. \n\n4) They have a decent selection of Asian beauty products. K Beauty is most popular here followed by Japanese beauty brands. I do wish more K Beauty products were offered but to be fair we do have K Beauty specific stores. \n\n5) Also Sephora gives back through there program called Sephora Stands which is funded through the purchase of select products. I know that through this program they support female entrepreneurs in the beauty business and donate to various non-profits through out the country. During Christmas this last year (maybe the year before??), a local non-profit was featured as a non-profit they donated to and it made me more excited to shop at Sephora.\n\n6) Product recommendations from staff are my life savers. Forever and ever my skin thanks you!\n\n7) Sign up for their rewards program for points for every dollar you spend. Spend points on fun minis to try!

My hair line resembles that of Grampa on the Munsters....but I've got five different shampoos (for different moods if not needs).  Sephora is my destination for goodies....mostly because Neiman's and Saks exhaust me.\n\nThe selection really is amazing...I never leave without something.  BUT there are two things that really put knots in my shorts.  You would imagine that the people who work there would be more knowledgeable about the selection.  Ask one of them for a bronzing powder that doesn't have sparkles...and watch their faces go blank.  Ask about a men's fragrance and you'll hear all about how the salesperson's uncle loves it...or their best friend uses it.  Expect anything else, like product information, and that blank stare will pop up again.  I'm constantly amazed at the number of people who praise the people who work there...even the girls at Macy's Downtown blow Sephora's people out of the water.  (Not a big fan of Macys, but their cosmetic people do tend to be better educated on product as a rule.)  While I'm bitching about the staff...can I just say that I thought M.A.C employees were the only folks allowed to look like Ru Paul with a hangover?  Being creative with cosmetics often involves talent rather than the nerve to wear six ounces of liquid eyeliner.  Maybe all the makeup is to disguise the shocked blank look that follows most questions.\n\nMy other huge gripe isn't really Sephora's fault.  I am so grossed out by the women who abuse (note I say abuse, not use) the testers.  I'm afraid to touch anything in that store sometimes.  Are those girls so dazzled by the shiny toys that they can't remember the basic rules of health.  I mean...how many women have dipped their paws into that glob of lipgloss that you plan on putting on your mouth?  Really...I stand there is shock sometimes; just watching what happens to those testers.  \n\nOh, I guess there is a third thing that just irritates me to an end....you can sign up for a frequent shopper card at Sephora.  The big draw to signing up is that you get gifts with every hundred dollar purchase.  Has anyone else been even mildly surprized to be handed a ridiculously small sample after dropping a hundred dollars?  Hit any cosmetic store in the country and get the same \"gift\" just by asking for a sample.  Mind you, I crave anything free...so I do end up spending the money...they win....but I always feel a little used.  \n\nOf course, none of the above bitches will stop me from walking in for my regular fix.

I was told by a very annoyed, dismissive young lady who didn't even look up that they had never carried the product (not true I had discovered the product at their store and feel in love with it.)

I mean, I guess I can understand why people want to avoid going to department store makeup counters, because I used to work at one and I know I certainly did my fair share of being snobby and disdainful.   But at least at a counter you can be sure that the testers are sanitary!  Like, it seems totally self-evident that you shouldn't go putting on lip gloss directly from a communal tube, but apparently it isn't.  Every time I go in here I'm scared I'll catch the herp.  \n\nActually, I have an entire laundry list of pet peeves about Sephora.  To wit:\n*Gross testers.  I know I already whined about this but it bears repeating.\n*The staff.  There are always a lot of Sephorites milling around, but they never seem to be helping anyone.  And, in the event that you should manage to engage one's assistance, they're not very knowledgeable (except for a handful of brand specialists).  This is the problem with carrying dozens of brands and then hiring clerks: no one has any product knowledge.  And from what I've seen of their handiwork (or lack thereof), most of them don't seem to have any artistry training either.\n*The limited inventory.  Sephora only carries the top ten or so SKUs of any given item.  So say you want a Chanel Glossimer - if you go to Sephora, you're limited to x number of top selling shades, and if you want one that isn't there, you have to go to a department store counter.  Understandable for most brands, I suppose, considering space is limited.  However, Stila, my personal favorite line, is OWNED by Sephora since being sold by Estee Lauder last year, and yet they still only stock the same limited inventory as always.  How else am I supposed to get my non-mainstream Stila fix?  I can't just fly to LA every time I want to try out a new eyeshadow.\n*The fact that half the shelves are always empty.  On two separate occasions I have gone in to buy a specific bottle of perfume, and on both occasions I went elsewhere in a huff because there weren't any there.  Couldn't some of the dozen or so employees just standing around devote a few minutes to a little thing called stocking?\n*They don't carry MAC.  Actually, that's less of a bad reflection on Sephora than a good reflection on MAC.\n\nMind you, I still shop here regularly.  There are some brands that you can't get anywhere else in Boston (the aforementioned and wonderful Stila, Urban Decay, Bourjois), and they have a lot of special edition gift sets that are good deals and too cute to pass up.  But I would never go here for a line that's sold in a department store , and I would most certainly never get my makeup done here.  \n\nAlso, not to be a jerk, but...I know everyone is all for getting the makeover without buying any product, but the fact remains that almost all beauty advisors at department stores work on commission, and the base pay is pretty low.  So when people waltz in there with the intention of being pampered for 30+ minutes and then waltz on out without taking so much as the lip gloss, it's a huge waste of the artist's time, particularly if the counter is busy.  You can't blame the artist fo having a little attitude when you're already trying to take advantage, is all I'm saying.  You'd be paying $50 for that kind of service at a salon.

This felt unusual because I'm usually asked within the first couple of minutes at the Washington Square location.  I assumed that it was an off-day.  I left without buying anything because they didn't appear to carry the foundation I was looking for in store.

I needed help finding a foundation that I was looking for and I found out that they didn't carry in store.  To match your color they ask what foundation/color you currently wear.  I don't remember exactly.  It is not top of mind as I was expecting to have the foundation available in store to match directly on my skin and the foundation that I currently wear is also not carried in store (see first visit) so I didn't have a good way of checking.  The Sephora employee then looked at shades on screen and made a guess at which one I'd be.  His rationale seemed reasonable, but I likely would have guessed at the same color at home.  I placed an order with him for the foundation and I then had a return to do so I went to the regular line.  There were two registers open, one with two customers and one with one. The cashier who had been helping the two customers called me forward.  The two customers didn't completely move away from the counter, but they also didn't say anything.  I walked up to the cashier and at the same time another customer came flying up to the two customers who had just gotten rung up and flung some items on the counter.

I think that is a fantastic and very customer friendly business move.  I picked out two that I liked and was given tiny little vials with enough to try for about a week or so each.

While the appointment was supposed to be 45 minutes (and I had told them my needs ahead of time so certain product could've been prepared in advance), I was there for nearly two hours because she had to a) clean the dirty makeup table and b) keep running around the store to find more various product for my face.

There was so much at Sephora that I didn't know where to begin. I wanted a strong (i.e. not too feminine/pretty) fragrance. Nothing too spicy. Not really floral or sweet but not too musky. I asked Miguel to point me to fragrances that fit the bill. He knew the entire inventory intimately. He showed me probably 10-15 fragrances, and I whittled my selections down to four. With four sample paper-swatches in my hand, I had no idea what the names of the four were. Miguel was able to identify each by brand and name by the scent alone! Is this not remarkable? \n\nFurthermore, I didn't know which of the three fragrances to get! He solved the problem by suggesting I buy the largest amount of my #1 fragrance, and buy the travel size spray of my #2. He knew that I really liked all four of the fragrances, but wasn't ready to commit to #3 and #4. He made samples of my #3 and #4 for me to decide if I like them enough to purchase them. The samples really helped because they were the last half of my preference list, but we also know that the fragrances can develop/evolve once mixed with one's pheromones. So, the samples will definitely help me decide. From the vendor's perspective, it gives me another reason to possibly even buy more fragrances! In fact, I am writing this review several weeks after my visit and may very well return to purchase full sizes of the samples that he provided me!  \n\nTHANK YOU, MIGUEL!

She was in fragrance (with beautiful bright colored hair) and she left her section to help me out with a good hair mask. \n\nI just really need to commend Jamie, he took me under his wing & gave me a whole skin care tutorial experience! I left there spending almost $200, but every purchase I LOVE and I am thankful that he took his time to help me. \n\nThe store is very clean and organized. They didn't have EVERYTHING I was looking for but it was still fine. It was 3 specific things I needed and they didn't have but other than that, I was still content. Again... I left the store smiling just cause of his customer service and all the knowledge he shared with me. That's how a customer (especially VERY loyal customer) deserves to be treated!

I stand up for cancer, my sister, mom & dad all have some type of cancer, and I'm trying not to go there. I'm a blogger, owned a group about fashion, talks & discusses or share tips & suggestions about chemicals, since 2000.

Someone in each department dressed in black, to help you, NOT here!  I looked & looked & looked for one to help me find a lip stain PENCIL I could try. I wasn't sure which one I needed or want. The brand I have in mind was NARS. It was around 2PM, so it's not crowded, after 5 mins. of searching for a sales associate, I found 2 talking in the corner with headphones in their ears (could it be, they only respond to customers by phone?)  He knew I needed help, he walked over to an associate who was with a customer, and he told me he's almost done and will be right with me shortly.  I stood, OK, walked around some more, I felt like a lost puppy waiting for her mommy!  Finally, I was getting impatient, found another associate but her department is MAC, but she did took me to the section NARS.  \n\nI didn't know much about the product,  no one was there to help me, so decided to just leave & be done with them!", "date": "2013-08-24 00:09:16"}, {"review_id": "0Jzwj1EVXMtxFHT3AfLZOA", "user_id": "KZnX-EiModi4wRzDQZuQHQ", "business_id": "t1sTnnAPEa9UgxuQa8w7Dw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "I have some general disclaimers about shopping in the Pru:\na. Don't go on the weekends.  If you do, bring plenty of patience and try to avoid just before dinner time when the crowds gather.

I don't even feel bad for you if you go around Christmas time and wait for hours; you knew it was coming!\n\nOn that note, I have zero other complaints about Sephora.  The above mentioned problems are totally out of their control and I think they manage them quite well.  Case in point: one time mom insisted on going in around dinner time; there was a rather large check-out line; once we were in line it was only about 10 mins thanks to the speed of all four cashiers.  Not only that, but they were FRIENDLY.\n\nI have one little secret about Sephora that will make me never stray from this store.  Please don't abuse it Yelpers...\nMADELINE.  Dear Lord do I love her.  My mom started with Madeline before the holidays when she walked in and said \"I don't know what I want, but I just ran out of EVERYTHING\".  Madeline knows that store like none other and will zip around showing you all sorts of options.  She will sample things on the back of your hand, your cheek, or whatever you want so that you don't walk around with a half done up face (she'll also do the other side if you like it).  She also makes reasonable suggestions.  I'm not a big makeup person; if I can't have it ALL done in 10 minutes I don't want it.  I'm also incredibly sensitive.  Most people at Sephora would consider me a huge PITA, but Madeline just rolls with it.  Best off is that she remembers us!  We've gone about 3 times now (tried to go 4 but mom walked out when she found out Madeline wasn't there) and she remembers what we bought and our preferences.  I have a serious girl crush on Madeline for having the capability to make me more girly.  She also acknowledges my budget and doesn't try to push multiple things on me at once; she almost always ends with \"Next time, tell me how you liked this and then maybe we can look at that\".\n\n\nI always liked Sephora before, but was slightly overwhelmed.

I was looking for a specific lipstick and would have bought pretty much anything they suggested too. It was just one of those days. I got zero help even after asking for it. I was told that the lipstick I wanted was \"over there\" and then they went back to talking.\nI went in again today knowing that I needed one thing, I wanted to try a couple and it would have been easy to sell me nearly anything again. No help. I wandered around for a half hour and didn't get so much as a \"hi\". The store was not that busy. I finally decided to just go and pay and not go crazy spending and when I got to the cash register I asked if I could please try a couple of perfume samples because I couldn't decide between them (and the husband wouldn't have been thrilled if I had spent a couple hundred buying both lol).

Huuuuge.  They carry pretty much any makeup line you can think of, from the Sugar brand that appeals to 10-year-olds just starting to play with lip gloss to Laura Mercier and Christian Dior for those who are serious about their makeup.  Their fragrance offerings are similarly comprehensive.  I love being able to go in here and sample ten different brown eyeshadows on the back of my hand while I wander around and try to decide which I like best.  It's great.  The return policy is extremely permissive, and I love their points reward system where you can get deluxe samples for spending so many dollars.\n\nNow for The Bad.\n\nThe bath and body lines.... well, let's just say that they carry the cupcake-scented shower gel and lotion sets from Dylan's Candy Bar.  Seriously, I don't think they carry a single bath and body line that doesn't smell like a Cherry Merry Muffin doll from the early 1990s.  I'm not 12 anymore, I don't want to reek of red velvet cake or gingerbread cookies or whatever.\n\nThe staff is less than ideal.  I do like that they let you browse by yourself and aren't all over you the minute you walk in, but if you do need their help, forget it.  It seems like they are given a woefully small education on the products they carry, including Sephora's house brand!  I have encountered exactly one helpful staff member there, who helped me pick a concealer color.  And this is all assuming you can manage to butt into the conversations that groups of sales associates are inevitably having around the sales floor.  The service isn't actively bad, but it could definitely use some help.  Better product training would be in Sephora's best interest, as right now I honestly get the impression that most of their sales associates are there for an employee discount perk.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nI have seen enough people smearing lip gloss and lipstick and mascara directly onto their  faces from the tube to make me permanently germaphobic.  If communicable diseases are not something you'd like to see in your future, test on your hand only - don't even use the special tester lip gloss wands they provide.  It is NASTY.\n\nThe Conclusion:\n\nIf you just want to play with makeup, come to Sephora.  If you want a serious overhaul of your cosmetics bag, you're better off at a department store counter, where the staff knows what they're doing and you are less likely to get pinkeye or H1N1.", "date": "2009-12-01 17:10:50"}, {"review_id": "fnBf_7KDf3R24yEcX7YBBQ", "user_id": "zkpu7YEsjef0NTrUq0aS6A", "business_id": "t1sTnnAPEa9UgxuQa8w7Dw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "sephora is great!

I don't know if there's a reason, or if that's changed, or if I'm just really bad at finding stuff, but eh. MAC's overrated, I'm just saying, I do occasionally buy their pigments & it'd be cool to just pick some up while at Sephora.\n\n& 2.) They don't carry Kryolan eyeshadows. FYI, Kryolan, hands down, makes some of the best & brightest shadows, & I SWEAR BY THEM. It's technically theatre/costume-ish makeup, & I guess most Sephora patrons don't want crazy popping colors. I've never found a store that actually carries their stuff, so I always have to order it online. Just saying. I should so become a distributor & start selling to the people who have complimented my eye makeup. If you want some Kryolan, drop me a line & I can try to hook you up. :)\n\nAnyways, yeah.

I came back another day because I couldn't decide which palette to get, either tarte or urban decay as far as colors and pigments and shimmer go. I got another mini makeover from one of the makeup artists, unfortunately I don't know her name. She reminds me of Kat Von D though, with lots of tattoos and wears a lot of product. She was really sweet too and I asked her to do one eye makeup look using the tarte palette and the other using the urban decay one lol so I had two different makeup looks to compare. One was more neutral/golden, the other one was cool and smoky. She didn't hesitate to help me out and agreed upon my request, and then after I decided to go with the urban decay palette she asked me if I wanted her to remove the other look and apply the same makeup look to the other eye to match so it wouldn't look weird and I wouldn't be walking around the mall with two different makeup looks on each eye. I like how you can also ask for samples of products here to try and you get samples sometimes and you get birthday gifts if you sign up for their beauty insider program.

I've gone to this Sephora a couple times in the past two weeks because I'm going on a trip soon and want to get new products for the trip. \n\nThe other afternoon, I went in to buy some new foundation and I needed to find a good match for my skin. I was one of about five customers in the store and none of the employees asked me if I needed help. I felt weird approaching the employees because they were standing together in groups talking. I saw one other employee helping another lady, so I wasn't about to interrupt her time with that customer. I stayed in the store for fifteen minutes, looking at some foundations and standing near the employees, looking at them to see if any were free. Yes, I could have gone over and asked them for help, but truthfully I didn't want to go over and interrupt their conversation because I had been standing next to them trying to make eye contact and it felt awkward. I ended up leaving the store and walking over to Saks and got some foundation from the very helpful woman at the Giorgio Armani makeup stall. \n\nBut this lack of attention isn't necessarily characteristic of the store. I went to this same Sephora again a few days later to look at lipsticks. This time, the store was packed with customers, but an employee immediately greeted me and asked if I needed help. Another employee asked to help as I was looking at  This time, I didn't need help since it was only lipstick, but I preferred being asked to being ignored. \n\nOther issues with this store is that products are often sold out and testers are sometimes missing, but that probably is because this is a popular location. My biggest issue with Sephora in general is that they carry a boring selection of perfumes, lacking in both classic and niche fragrances, but that's probably because the store is meant to appeal to young women who tend to prefer popular clean or sweet scents to more exciting options. \n\nLong story short, I would go to this Sephora if I already knew which product I needed or if I wanted to test products that I knew the store carried. However, if I wanted a more personal consultation or I wanted to get something from a high end line, even one carried at Sephora, I would go to the Saks makeup counter instead, both for their personal touch and for great samples.", "date": "2015-08-14 13:11:54"}, {"review_id": "QP9iIJRZP7AsVqgVRg64wA", "user_id": "qQa1gh3jijjN98_JpWQ55w", "business_id": "t1sTnnAPEa9UgxuQa8w7Dw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "This is a great store!

They're shooting for a premiere retail store that stocks the latest and most desirable makeups, fragrances and beauty services while offering a professional staff trained in \"the science of sephora'...e.g. they have sales associates who can easily interact with a variety of clientele, know many popular products sold like the back of their hands and also are trained to provide consultations and mini-makeovers on occasion. This vision is really more or less what you would expect of a place that has such a sterling reputation around world. \n\nSo why does this particular location fall short?  Truth be told, I don't know exactly why  and it irks me that I can't pinpoint the problem. But I won't let that hold me back from trying to figure it out. \n\nBeing someone who more or less who tags along on weekly make-up shopping trips, I am in a unique position to judge places such as Ulta, Sephora and the MAC counter. I am not particularly interested in the products or services  that they offer but I've grown fascinated by the people who are completely wrapped up in that world. A great many people (men and women alike) take make up very seriously and they want to shop in an environment that enables them make the right choice, the first time, and Sephora is usually the place where that happens.  For you outdoorsy people, Sephora is like REI because not only do they have a knowledgeable staff, they also have an excellent selection and an exemplarily return policy just in case things don't work out. This particular location however is missing some of that magic and I can't quite put my finger on it because objectivly they seem to have their game together.\n\nI can tell you for sure that the shortcoming probably isn't the beauty consultation services that they offer.  In fact, just the other day I heard a lady exclaim that the beauty specialist was a \"god send\". He had helped her shape her eyebrows in a attractive fashion that she definitely agreed with. I also heard some girls talking excitedly about getting a makeover. So obviously they have that department in check if they find appeal from teens to middle aged adults.  And as far as cosmetic knowledge goes, I watched many of the sales associates engage with customers to find out what they were looking for a try to steer them in the right direction. I even saw a few walk customers throughout the store, making suggestions and sharing their opinions. I will say that they need to bump up the mobile check out presence but that is a new enough feature in these stores that most customers don't look for it anyway and instead migrate to line out of habit. As far as  selection is concerned, this store may seem small, but to be honest I think they display some newer products before the both Washington Square locations do, so in that sense it is at an advantage. \n\nWhen it comes down to it I think the main drawback may be as simple as the location and layout. When you're on the streets of downtown you have people who live on those streets chilling just outside your store entrance. This is to be expected in town like Portland where street corner musicians are embraced but it doesn't exactly scream \"high end french cosmetics and fragrances sold here!\" either. Unless they get a block sized store front like Tiffany's or the Apple store, where they have complete and utter control of their outward appearance, I don't think they can avoid this clash of cultures. I get the feeling that this store might be more comfortable inside the Pioneer Place Mall instead of across the street from it. Lastly, the store feels cramped, dark and a little dingy. It is probably just bad lighting and layout... I am not a product display specialist, so I don't really have any tips to improve the setup but it does need improving as it currently feels like a dark maze.\n\nOn a final note, I want to be clear that I think the staff and products meet the standards of any other Sephora. You will find what you need here and you will be met with excellent customer service. That said, there is definitely something a bit off about this location, even if I can't quite put my finger on it.", "date": "2014-08-06 19:13:04"}, {"review_id": "Mzgj4SSjgV0xfA2mmUyW3g", "user_id": "P4bjzSDGz_tOuqxV6jI5FA", "business_id": "3iExBNijNUYPuxsUwAgLAg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "What lady young and old doesn't love Sephora?

I'm all of them.\n\n1. THE MAN\nYep, how many bored men do you see getting dragged around here with sullen faces and all the enthusiasm of a medieval death casket? A fair number. It's progesterone hell in here, my fertility count is rapidly diminishing with every minute I spend here but sadly I'm often made to hang out here for hours not minutes. GROAN. Shit, I get worried that MY period is going to get in synchrony with the other customers and I don't even have a Va-JJ!!!\n\n2. THE RECYCLER\nWhoa there Sephora! Do you want to perhaps try wasting some more tissue, foam pads and QTips next week? There's not nearly enough landfills already bursting with one-use disposable crap tinted with chemical-laden cosmetics. Pollute some more so that we can get mutant plants eating our babies some day in the future. Seriously, it's fun that there is so much free shit to try, but wow if your trash cans don't end up looking like Zoolander has been cleaning-up after coal mining again.\n\n3. THE SCIENTIST\nDo you have any idea how much of everything the cosmetics industry pedals is total bollocks? Active ingredients: aqua, stearate, lipids... so that's water, soap and fat, right? Well, Sephora is no exception. In my metrosexual search for some expression line remover, they thrust $100 tiny bottles of serum on me that countless internet sites have declared 'complete rubbish'. What's wrong with the $25 serum bottles you stock... oh, they're no good... not the right active ingredients. Well, Sephora here's the thing - none of them show any proof of ever working anyway and the active ingredients are all BS anyway, save a few. Besides, why stock stuff your staff thinks is no good?\n\nSo that's my three reasons not to like you. I know my GF loves you so you get 2 stars from her by my proxy. You can get more if...\n1. You give guys something to do - TV, newspapers, couch, XBox...\n2. You stop wasting so much plastic with free Q-Tips and such\n3. You stock stuff that experts says works, not just any crud you can mark up.

Seriously. I have converted from being a strictly online Sephora shopper. I forgot how fun it is to actually visit the store. \n\nFirst of all, it can be a bit overwhelming- especially if it's crowded. However somehow through all the chaos you still find someone to help you. The customer service here is fantastic- Sephora obviously knows what they're doing when they hire people- they are all knowledgeable in different fields. Here is what my situation went like: \n\n\nI walked into Sephora looking for a good reliable foundation and a few skincare products- including a new moisturizer. First I approached a nice blonde girl who started talking to me about the foundations, and then handed me over to another girl who was the \"skincare expert\" and could help me pick out some products. Now, I too know a thing or too about esthetics and skincare, and I could tell this girl knew what she was talking about (she also mentioned she worked at a dermatologist office as well). She picked out a great exfoliator for me, told me it would last me 8 months, and also helped me pick out a great moisturizer that wasn't too expensive (in fact she stressed that the cost isn't always the indicator of the quality) \n\nTHEN, she passed me to another lovely girl who was apparently the \"makeup expert\" and helped me pick out a great HD foundation, then she brought me to her makeup chair, put it on me with my consent, and basically ultimately gave me a full makeover. The foundation was perfect, and she didn't pressure me to buy anything else but did grab any other products I wanted for me so all I had to do was sit there and she came back with a basket full of goodies. \n\nTHEN I got a few free gifts at the checkout- one for being a Beauty Insider member (and they are great gifts- I got a Laura Mercier primer), and one for uh.. I guess purchasing a lot of makeup? I dunno. \n\nBasically going there is seriously like being in a toystore as a kid as another Yelper mentioned. You will leave with a lighter wallet, sure- but everything here is high quality- especially the staff's knowledge and customer service. \n\nLove it, but I need to stay away until my next paycheck otherwise there will be serious damage ;)", "date": "2010-02-05 03:12:22"}, {"review_id": "6jJ9t2T6L9RP-TNL7PvFgA", "user_id": "qVoySxiQJM-_7k6c_NJdQQ", "business_id": "eerQn-FDlltuN1KLevSvxA", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Worst customer service and rudest management I have ever met.

But I had a shoot the next day so I went In desperation for the first time in years. On Sunday, July 14 I went into Sephora, desperately looking for help. The ladies at the door were less than enthusiastic when I walked in. The store was crowded, probably a tiring and hectic day. No problem. I was helped by a lovely person and we bonded briefly over being from the south. I wish I knew their name, because they were amazing and the only positive thing about my experience.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter securing the product, I made my way to the cash wrap maze to pay. There was a pretty good line, so I waited. Suddenly I felt like someone was watching me. I turn around and notice the security guard lady literally peering at me from behind the line entrance barrier. At first I shrug it off...but then notice she is only watching me, and as I move in the line, she is watching me in the mirror. Wtf. The store was incredibly crowded, she was the only security, and she was ONLY watching me...the only black person in the store.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, July 17th around 7pm I went back to return the product as it ended up giving me a bad reaction. I walked in and was greeted very warmly by three very kind ladies. I headed straight to the cash wrap. The store was a lot less crowded, but still had people inside, spread out and wandering around. As I am nearing the wrap stand I look up and\u00a0\u00a0notice a man starring directly at me and whispering into his earpiece. Around the same time, the same lady security guard is looking aimlessly at some stuff, but when she sees me she perks up. I stand in line behind the person who is being helped. The security guard walks over to where I am standing and stands directly next to the cash wrap, watching me! During my entire transaction she stands there watching me and doesn't budge. Just puffing out her chest, arms crossed in front of her, watching me. THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STORE, BUT SHE STOOD THERE, WATCHING ME. SHE WAS THE ONLY SECURITY PERSON IN THE ENTIRE STORE, BUT SHE STOOD THERE, WATCHING ME. I WAS THE ONLY BLACK PERSON IN THE STORE, AND SHE STOOD THERE, WATCHING ME.\u00a0\n\n\nI am livid, offended, and honestly pretty hurt.\u00a0I want to give people the benefit of the doubt..I want so badly for the situation to be something else before I have to admit it is because of my skin color.

Than as I check out she greets me with you all set . Not the warm hi did you find everything you needed. The next person who happened to be a white woman she said to her, hi how are you ????

I visit you often because you have things, that for some reason, I feel like I just gotta have! This is mainly makeup products and usually very specific items that I know I can't find at Ulta or at a specialty shop like MAC. This location in particular is in the heart of Easton Town Center, outside closer to Macy's and the Apple store. It is almost always busy af. It doesn't matter the day, the time, or if the holidays are around or corner or not. It can be very frustrating moving around or really even looking for something because people are constantly bombarding you from every direction. Pro tip - try to avoid coming here on the weekends. I'm even guilty of leaving with nothing because I honestly just couldn't stand to be in there with so much going on. Loud music, colors, people, things, I feel like I'm spiraling! I also have to agree with some of the other reviews on this page. It's hard for me to shop in peace and enjoy myself because every five seconds, not only is another customer bumping into me but an associate is trying to lend me and a hand in some way.  I was in there this past weekend and I swear I had 5 different people try to help me in the whole 10 minutes that I was in there. My sister and I were having fun picking out different shades for each other and we were totally fine on our own. Just let us liveeeee!!\n\nNow, as you likely already noticed, I do give this spot a solid three stars. One thing I really do like about Sephora is that as you buy, you collect points that you can then use to get free items. It's like every now and then you get a little surprise present! I also appreciate that Sephora allows you to get samples of products you've never tried. This is another reason why I'll swing by here instead of Ulta. Ulta doesn't let you sample anything and if I'm going to spend forty bucks on a foundation, I want to make sure I'm going to like it. Returns here are also hassle free. I'm a beauty insider member (free) so even if I loose my receipt, they can pull up the information they need in order to get it taken care of easily. Also, while I prefer to be left to shop on my own, everyone is really nice. I've never run into anyone being rude like others mentioned. \n\nWill I return? Yes. Will I be excited about it? Naaaaa.

I've had such a horrible time finding my niche when it comes to what I want/need for everyday makeup. I was in Sephora yesterday in the Prudential for the first time since they reopened after their renovations. It was a very busy Friday evening, I mean BOOMING. I'm pretty sure it was a long day for them as it was for myself. I work retail on Newbury St and had just gotten off at 7pm and headed straight to Sephora and it was a mad house. After walking around for a few minutes, taking in the new scene, (I also scope out artists who seem like they have good vibes before asking for help), I found my prey. I met Gabriel and let me tell you, he was FLAWLESS in every sense of the word.\n\nHe took the time to listen to all my concerns and past experiences with products - we established that I may have bad reactions to the SPF in bb creams and tinted moisturizers. He didn't try to sell me on tons of product, instead he actually insisted on giving me a few samples to try at home before deciding on a foundation. Everything he matched me with was SPOT ON. He was very knowledgeable in all of the brands and automatically 86'd the ones the he knew wouldn't work toward my ultimate goals or didn't offer something to match my color, literally walking down aisles stating, \"no, no, this brand doesn't have dark enough colors. this one is too oily. that brand doesn't offer the right undertones for you\" without even picking them up. I was honestly in awe of him. He took his time with me, he wanted me to get exactly what I wanted. I purchased a great concealer that is 1000x better than the one I've been using, and a mattifying setting spray that left me speechless. The first sample of foundation that he gave me, I used today and I love that the way he applied it in store is the same way it looked when I did it myself at home. Gabriel is the BEST artist I have come across ... and I've come across tons over the years. Kudos to Sephora for finding this gem, he will be my go to from now on.

I really do. The selection is awesome (albeit no MAC, as Chloe D. said). This is where you go when you want to look like the girls in the glossy magazines. This is Mecca for makeup industry professionals. \n\nHowever, there are certain things about Sephora that make me want to run screaming for the exit and go kill some bugs, play some video games, eat a steak, and watch a good bloody zombie movie. Really, it's just too much. Examples:\n\n-The crowds are ridiculous. Granted, we were there on a Saturday, but every time I go into Sephora it's packed. One must navigate their way around girly girls looking for their fix. There was even a stroller or two blocking the narrow aisles between displays.\n-There's a real attitude problem among a lot of the customers. I had found the Urban Decay display and was checking out some of the eye shadows when some guy (maybe a makeup artist or an off-hours drag queen, who knows) rudely informed me that I was \"in his way\". Yes, maybe I was in his way, but there was certainly a nicer way to say it. Also, it's not necessary to completely block the display, preventing anyone else from taking a gander at the sparkly wares that drain my wallet. \n-After about 15 to 20 minutes in this store I start to lament my arsenal of drugstore makeup at home, my decision to go bare-faced into the store, etc. This is mixed with irritation at the other customers crowding the aisles, the strong scent of perfume and chemicals, and the need to GTFO before I spend more money.\n-Sephora even has a makeup line for little girls so they can emulate their ridiculously high-maintenance mommies and older sisters. Chloe and I think it should be called \"Li'l Trollop\". Catchy, isn't it?\n\nIt's apparent that I have mixed feelings about Sephora. I love the selection of colors and products that one simply can't find at CVS or Walgreens.

While we were looking at various products no one came up to ask if we had any questions. We were standing with product in our hands in the middle of the aisle while there were about eight associates standing around gossiping by the makeup stations. I had to call out \"is anyone actually working today because not one person has spoken to us since we walked in the door\" And they all turned and just looked at me. It was like they all just remembered they were at work. So finally an exceptionally tall white guy comes over and says \"well I'll help you now\" - I shouldn't have had to ask. I shouldn't have had to ask eight people what they're doing. What hurt the most is that my cousin who is a darker brown skin complexion says to me, that's how they treat me in Boston, I guess I'm just used to it. That is NOT okay.

The makeup displays were almost always grungy and filthy, and I generally didn't like to shop there. In the last couple of years, they moved the store down the hall, in a slightly smaller store, with bright lighting and much cleaner digs. I thought that moving to a smaller store meant they would lose some of the brands, but most everything that I liked is still available. \n\nThe sales associates/makeup artists themselves are a bit of a \"your-mileage-may-vary\" deal. Some of them are really enthusiastic. Some of them are really haughty. I generally like to be left alone when I'm shopping, so I don't really mind either way. They used to do quick makeup demos for free, and if there were bored employees, they might give you a full makeover -- however, I'm not sure of how that works now, and whether you have to make a purchase for a makeover (I might assume so). \n\nThey are more than willing to make samples of anything you want in the store. Once, I had needed to buy some foundation, but they had run out of my shade. The MA was more than happy to make me a giant sample from the tester to tide me over, and was willing to make a phone-order for me and waive the shipping costs. Everytime I've wanted perfume samples, they've always made it for me. \n\nOf course, the store doesn't not have the full range of items offered on the website, but it's a great place to test and experiment with the makeup.

When I explained my situation about just moving here, shipping and American Sephora and the brands they carry, they were very understanding and helpful with new product recommendations and samples. \n\nIt is slightly weird for me, that Sephora in Canada carries different brands (no DDF, wtf?!) than American stores, but I will get over it.

I am a VIB member.  And I have NEVER, ever had such a nasty experience as at this particular branch of Sephora.\n\nI went to this store in the Florida Mall as it's supposed to be large and well-stocked, which it somewhat was.  But I go to Sephora stores not just for stock (I could get more online) - I go to feel special for 15 minutes, to be waited on/asked if I need help, and to learn about new items, then finally, to be treated well at check out.\n\nNone of that happened this trip.  I was flat out treated RUDELY from the time that I called the store to inquire about a makeover (where, though I repeated several times that I was a VIB member and was calling to schedule my complimentary makeover, I was told that it would cost $50), to the next moment after I said I didn't care about the cost but that, hey, mum and I wanted appointments at the same time, whereupon the gal on the phone sneered \"Oh, we're too busy at that time to accommodate you and your mother\" without suggesting any other solution.  \n\nThen into the store itself - what a bummer unfun time.\n\nNot one single associate approached my mum and I to help us.  We had to seek out an associate to show us where more lotion was stocked for a popular brand we wanted.  This after we had been standing in front of the display for 5 minutes.  And searching around.  And loudly wondering \"Do you think they are sold out?\" etc.  And several associates were standing not even one row away chatting about non-work (gossip?!) during all this.\n\nThen, upon going to check out, I saw that there was no one in line (in fact, there was hardly anyone in the store, and so, how interesting it must have been for the associates that day to get to stand and all chat with each other) and walked up to the register.  The sales associate at the register shrilled \"You need to go to where the line starts, over there.\"  Well, so I did - even though there was no one there.  So mum and I stood and stared at the \"line entrance\" at this lone associate, who then turned and fake-smiled \"Oh, I can't ring you up as I am holding my check out envelope now.\" (she was holding what looked like a bank plastic envelope, but still!).  Then when an associate did check me out (after we stood and waited about 40 more seconds), she didn't know to give me my new VIB card (duh!).  Um, good thing I have been VIB for a while and I knew to ask for it.\n\nAnd the final insult to injury was when, at check out, I asked for my three free samples (oh, yes, I did buy over $115 worth of product, again, like usual), I was told in a simpering voice that they only make custom samples.  I asked if they could check and see if they had any pre-made as I didn't have time to make samples.  One would think that they could check without eye-rolling and sighing.  She dug around in the drawer under the register and came up with one sample - and offered me two of the same thing.  Really?!\n\nAll in all, it was the WORST Sephora experience of my long shopping history with Sephora.  If I had been a first time guest, I would NEVER have returned.  No wonder the store was nearly empty in a packed-to-the-gills mall.  \n\nI suggest you skip this bunch of self-absorbed twits and either shop them online or try another makeup store - Nordstroms is always nice :)", "date": "2013-01-08 02:23:20"}, {"review_id": "juNWIBnR_F0ZUiCAO-K9vA", "user_id": "4TTOknBZuKMXF-z218YQqw", "business_id": "dE2l6IJ8Xck0x1CcFAO02A", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 3, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Any makeup freak would squirm with delight with the very mention of this store's name.

I thought they must be preparing for some after work rush, because there were not very many shoppers yet.  \n\nMelanie stopped by and asked me to let her know if I needed help finding anything. Actually, yes. \"I have this crappy concealer from some grocery store aisle, and despite it being \"Light Pale\" in color, it is too dark for me.\" I have decided that being 30, I should spend a little more time and money taking care of myself. So, I was okay splurging for some makeup, even though I don't wear it daily. (Which actually might be why I was okay with splurging... it tends to last long for me.) \n\nI told Melanie I wasn't looking for all-over concealer, just for spots and under eyes. She brought me straight to a particular product and dabbed a little on my hand to show me how soft it is.. Not greasy. Then she put some under my eyes, and asked me to pat it in lightly with my finger; not bad. I think I'll go with that. She then suggested an eye cream to help my dark circles. She basically told me, \"You're young, but you need to take care of that skin.\" She probably sensed my hesitation, as I hadn't already mentally cleared that purchase with myself. She quickly offered, \"I'll make you a sample to try.\" Wow, I like that idea!  \n\nI continued browsing and picked up a few other little things.. and Melanie found me a few minutes later. She explained how/where to put the cream on my eye bones (technical term?) and also gave me the product name written down, next to hear name. So cool. I'm down with this process. She was never pushy at all.\n\nThroughout my shopping, I was greeted a few other times by other employees, but never felt bothered or annoyed. Some stores for women have many employees on the floor handing out baskets, and - it feels like - either dryly offering assistance or completely ignoring you.. ya know.. the pink panty place (which I'm overall not against..) and for either reason I find myself dodging these ladies just to avoid the awkwardness.... but it was definitely a bit refreshing and relaxing to shop in Sephora. \n\nWhen I went to check out, the cashier humored me when she asked if I have one of those frequent shopper cards... she tried 2 phone numbers, 2 email addresses and 2 names to see if I already had a card registered - and some I tried were mom's - and then finally asked if I just wanted my own card. Yea! Immediately, I had 60-or-so points for my purchase that day, and she popped like 2 extra free samples into my bag. I felt like I was definitely getting a good value here, and even if not, they made me FEEL like it, which goes a long way.  \n\nA couple side notes.. I love the slightly-bigger-than-sample sized goodies you can purchase - some near the front door and some on the way to the register. There are tons of beauty products and perfumes, as well, and just so you know, they actually have an entrance at the \"back\" of the store out to the parking lot.. so if you want to just run in, you don't have to go through the mall or any department stores.

I was looking to try a new foundation and couldn't decide between two and the staff member gave me samples of both so I could try them first.

I was surprised to see other ladies smearing product on to their faces as though they were getting ready for a night out in the store, so the samples looked dirty and damaged or overused.

I was out running errands and decided to stop by Sephora ( Perimeter Mall) to grab some face wipes and to get and save my color IQ number.

To make a looong story short , customer service was horrible. I asked a guy I saw standing by fragrance about getting matched so of course he got on the headset/walkie and asked if anyone was available, I actually saw and heard the person that responded she was helping someone at the moment, so I decided to browse a little plus test out the foundation I was interested in ( I seriously feel the guy with the blueish hair ( he looked great by the way awesome makeup / lashes) I felt he was really watching me we kept locking eyes and I feel he basically put the other cast members on alert or something as if I was shoplifting or something as he was talking on the walking and looking at me I saw the others began to look at ME . I felt really uncomfortable , I mean granted I had no makeup on and was super casual but I also didn't plan on going there while running errands but that's no reason to profile a person) Noooow back to simply wanting a color IQ number as I browsed and waited the lady that said she would help me , was helping lots of other people I spotted her as I continued to wait we'd lock eyes she'd say nothing at all this happened at least 4 times , I went back over sort of by fragrance and just stood there , she finally acknowledged me she was very apologetic and asked if I was in a rush I said yes and let her know all I wanted was an IQ match number so I can save it in my account. I was in there for almost 25 minutes it was the first time I ever felt so uncomfortable. I will probably just order online and continue to enjoy my Play Box deliveries.

I remembered I was out of a moisturiser sample I received and was interested in purchasing the full sized version. But I was conflicted between drunk elephant or tried and true tatcha. I had just finished applying the moisturiser to my face that I had received a sample of (drunk elephant) the one that's very moisturising. Cause with being out in the sun I like a deep moisture to use after using my murad cleanser. I haven't had breakouts since puberty in middle school, and I have never had \"acne\" I've never had more than 2-3 blemishes at a time. I do have larger pores along my nose, but that's besides the point.  SO after applying the drunk elephant moisturiser I smiled in the mirror, I turned around to notice the woman running the skincare section and a young guy employee giving me condescending glares while looking me up and down. So I smiled because I have never had a bad Sephora experience. I went over to ask them which of the two I was interested in was better or their favorite. The guy snickers and looks over to her, RUDE, and then she blinked slowly and rolled her eyes then told me \"your skin is so acne prone you need to use something with no oil\" it's not what she said it's how she said it. (I sound like my mother) and secondly I had ONE BREAKOUT ON MY JAW AND A SCAB ON MY CHIN FROM WHERE MY DOG SCRATCHED ME LIKE ARENT YOU A SKINCARE \"specialist\" CANT YOU RECOGNISE THE DIFFERENCE!? Also I haven't had the best eating habits recently so my skin appeared a bit oilier than it normally is ALSO I had just applied that moisturiser. She continues to repeatedly tell me how oily my skin is and how broken out I am instead of helping me find products. And how acne prone she can ~tell~ my skin is. So I ask for other recommendations and she reluctantly shows me a few and then when I say thank you, she mockingly matches my town and says \"yoooure welcome\".

I walked into the store and was greeted by two or three different employees who sweetly asked how I was doing and if I needed help. I picked out my items and cashed out (cashier was extremely sweet too). I went to my car and examined one of my items, which was an eyeshadow palette. To my horror, I noticed that two of the eyeshadows were swatched (meaning someone used their finger to swipe the shadow and sample it). Sephora has samples of pretty much every item they sell, so I am not sure why someone would take a brand-new palette and swatch that, but they did, and lucky me, I bought that palette. \n\nSo I took the palette and my receipt and returned to the store. I went back to the display and picked up another palette, this time opening it to ensure that no one had swatched it. I VISUALLY examined the palette and saw a small smudge on one of the eyeshadows that could possibly have been swatched, so I carefully placed the palette back in its box and back on the display. \n\nAlmost immediately, this tall blonde girl (hereby known as TBG) swooped down on me.\n\nTBG: \"OK, are you going to buy that? You opened it.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, but I didn't touch it.\"\n\nTBG: \"Doesn't matter,\" she said nastily, literally shoving the palette I just examined back into my hand.\n\nMe: \"Oh, sorry.\" \n\nI took the palette to the register. OK, guess I was going to end up with a palette that was a bit smudged. I felt embarrassed and slightly defeated, but I figured store policy is store policy, I just didn't know it. \n\nAn older bearded gentleman cashed me out this time. I explained the situation to him and he nodded, proceeding with the exchange. He asked if I had opened the new palette to make sure it looked fine.\n\nMe: \"Yes, I did. It looked OK... I didn't know that once you open something, you have to buy it!\"\n\nNice man: \"Oh, nah!!!\" he waved dismissively.\n\nMe: \"Your co-worker just told me off!\" I semi-joked. Afterwards, I thanked him for being so nice. I checked the palette again in the car and decided that the small smudge was most likely a manufacturing defect and not enough to get riled up about it, so I left.\n\nTall blonde girl, not sure what your problem was, but you should be nicer to customers. Just beware of her next time you're at the store -- don't open anything in front of her, lest you be forced to buy it!

I tried the Stila it looked cakey on my skin and I had read reviews for it previously and was not interested. I asked the Stila rep what was wrong with the Kat Von D foundation and if he recommended any other foundations in the store and he blatantly said no and dismissed all my other suggestions saying that nothing was as good as Stila.

As soon as I walked in I felt uncomfortable. There was no greeting and it was if no one was interested in helping my friend and I. After having picked up my fenty foundation(mind you I had to color match my own self) I proceeded to look around the store and finally someone came up to me and asked if They could assist me and I said no. They then consistently decided to keep asking me if I was ok and if I needed their assistance after repeatedly kept telling them that I was fine. I then began to keep looking at makeup and skincare in the store and the employees kept following me. At one point the employee (a woman who I speculate to be the manager because she was signing returns) decided to speak into her microphone and told someone to check the security cameras. She said it loud and near us I suppose as a way to scare my friend and I. However we were unbothered because we knew we had done nothing wrong and had nothing to hide. They kept following us and watching us throughout the store and the experience was very uncomfortable. Until one of the African American female workers asked us for help and she actually seemed genuine unlike the others. So instead of buying a skincare product I decided to leave it and ended up just paying for the foundation I really needed. While I was at the checkout counter my friend noticed that the employees were still eyeing us and I felt hurt. The cashiers at the time were the only ones who didn't view us as inferior and helped me check out just fine. I felt discriminated against, whether it was because of my age or appearance I am unsure they were extremely unprofessional. I was dissatisfied with the treatment I received and not to mention as we were leaving one of the other employees tapped the security Guard and said \"hey\" while pointing at my friend and I.while the security guard payed no attention to her (mind you were are 17 year olds and Hispanic, and have the money to buy the products we wanted) I truly hope the employees at question get reprimanded for their discriminatory actions.", "date": "2018-06-11 17:30:25"}, {"review_id": "tzuTCY24v4ac-NbXGAvV2Q", "user_id": "IDL_tEdiUx2Rc6P3Zy6OKA", "business_id": "dE2l6IJ8Xck0x1CcFAO02A", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "So I have always been a HUGE fan and supporter of Sephora but today I was so disappointed.

I love all the different lines they have, and that you can test basically anything!

SO NOT THE CASE! I wish I could give it zero stars. The workers here are rude, unhelpful, and even condescending. The managers are no better, so perhaps they're following by example. Either way, they need a major customer service upgrade. I mean, I don't even enjoy my time when I go to that store and that's saying something - because it takes a lot to run Sephora. \n\nI went this weekend because of the 15% off for VIB members. First of all, I spent well over $75 in skincare, and they did not offer me the complimentary facial like I've had at other locations. Maybe they don't offer it here (just another reason to stay away) - but the store manager basically acted like I was a crazy person and was making it up out of nowhere. She could have literally called any other location in Atlanta to see if it was a thing (it is, I promise)... and if so, she could have asked if I could redeem that at another store instead. Just a thought!\n\nThen, I went to check out. I had a return (moisturizer that was purchased by someone as a gift - I had tried that particular brand before and didn't love it. When I received it as a gift I was like ehhh I'll return and swap for something else). By the way, I never even had opened the lotion. It was in its original packaging and even had the little seal in tact. It was very clearly never used (not like that should matter because they should take it back regardless with their return policy). Anyway, the lady who was ringing me up, Kiki, was awful. She examined the lotion for like 15 minutes and acted like it was unacceptable to take back. Keep in mind I had about $200 worth of other products in my bag to purchase after I returned the lotion. She had a rather snarky attitude about the whole ordeal - and then even made a confrontational comment saying \"you bought this lotion in December\". I told her - yes, I bought a bottle of that lotion in December and when tried it I didn't like it. So, when I received this bottle as a gift, I wanted to return it for something instead. She rolled her eyes and scoffed, then continued to ring up my other items. She NEVER ONCE said thank you for my purchase, or for being such a loyal member to Sephora. She basically tossed my bag at me after I paid, and then tilted her head to look around at the next guest. \n\nI will NEVER come back to this store.

Then she shouted at me, \"I was just saying please do not open the package.\"  They did not have a sign that indicated \"Please do not open the package.\"  She did not need to shout at me; they need to turn down the background music and she needed to come closer to talk to me because she wore a mask.\n\nFurthermore, it was not good to see that there were a lot of staff on the floor chatting or just standing with only several customers in the store.  Also, they should put all the sizes of the same products together on the shelf because customers might not find all the sizes they needed if they put them in a separated area.  \n\nMoreover, they confused us by making the tax appear twice on the receipt so I thought they charged us twice for the PST and GST.  I realized that when I looked at the receipt after I got home so I called them.  The employee on the phone said she would get the manager.  Then she said the manager was helping another customer and I might need to wait for several minutes. Then the manager picked up the phone right away and talked to me.  She told me that I needed to go back into the store.  This was unnecessary because she could simply look up my transaction in the computer with the information on my receipt.  So I told her I could give her the information on the receipt and she can look up my transaction in the computer.  Then she asked me when was I in the store so I told her the time.  I offered to give her my phone number to access my profile but she said she did not need it.  She told me she did not see anything from that time period.  It was very inefficient for them to check the transaction using the time of transaction and not the transaction number of the receipt.  She could have used my phone number to pull up my profile and see my transaction history.  Then she said, \"Oh, you have the receipt, that's great.\"  That means she either misheard me at the beginning or she did not know the faster way to find the transaction.  I was disappointed because she was the manager.  She found the transaction finally and she told me that she did not know why the system would divide the amount of GST and PST on the receipt (if I add the two lines of GST, it would equal to the 5% of the subtotal; this applies to PST too).  She said this was the first time she saw this.

The problem with this location is that they need a bigger space and more staff. Sephora is a huge retailer in the province's largest mall, yet they don't have enough wall and floor space to hold all the things (and heaven help you if you want something that isn't on the shelf).\n\nI've enjoyed consistently good recommendations in the skincare area, and have had a couple of good colour matches for foundation. The makeup artists tend to be quite friendly, with the odd few exceptions along the way. I find that the more unfriendly artists have the attitude that they are there to work on clients, not be in retail, which not jive with Sephora's reason for being.\n\nI am not sure if they still do this, but back in the day, the brand reps used to do training with the floor staff while the store was open. Oh did this piss me off. Heaven forbid you should interrupt. It pissed me off when I worked retail and it still does now as a customer. You don't get to hog all the sales associates when there are customers in the store. And management, you don't get to allow this. Do training before the store opens or after it closes or hold a seminar.\n\nAnyway, while the cashiers are always friendly and Sephora's return policy is amazing, check your bill carefully before you leave. I was once charged for an item I didn't buy, and when I realized the error and went out of my way to bring the receipt back, the store manager made like it was my fault.

I have even connected with a few of them on social media we vibe so much.\n\nSome of them are so downright awful they wont even look at you. If you ask them a question they will ignore you or walk away. \n\nIf i bring my kids (Im a young mom) I am followed relentlessly to no end. My kids are generally well behaved, quiet and actually enjoy occasionally swatching a highlight or a shadow on themselves. But the notion that because I'm young with children means : will steal, is disheartening. I reach rouge status well before I need to, every year without fail. For the past 10 years. \n\nA lot of the girls get annoyed when you ask for help. I cant tell if they are just stressed from life, the job itself, or sales requirements but it makes for a stressful experience. I don't want to be rushed when I'm in the disneyworld for 20 somethings. I want to enjoy my sweet precious generally child free time trying out stuff and making sure I'm investing in the right products. \nOn the plus side, you can bring your dog. Yes its in the mall, but its a company policy world wide. \nIf you make connections you can get good samples. Don't ask for them at the desk ask for them on the floor. And really do take advantage of the samples because if more people ask they might actually start holding some at the desk like they are supposed to (take the hint sephora)\nThe lighting is generally awful so make sure you really reallllllyyyyyy look when you get color matched. Try to find someone who has a similar skin tone as you they tend to be better at finding the right stuff.", "date": "2017-04-18 15:25:59"}, {"review_id": "QqvGKU2i2Plh6GEXvbEspQ", "user_id": "4pCccUOx_iBWCwtv-ObTBQ", "business_id": "B9q0I-umid5ONCkv1nqojw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 4, "funny": 2, "cool": 3, "text": "I didn't really get the whole buzz about Sephora coming to BC until I tried this store out, since I was pretty unfamiliar with it in the States.  I have been into the Metrotown location several times now and I am definitely a fan.  I brought a friend in on the weekend who was also unfamiliar with it, and assumed, as I had, that it was just over priced cosmetics.  Nope!\n\nI love the customer service you get here.  And now that the frenzy after it originally opened has died down, it is a very pleasant place to visit.  I'm going to list some things like Rachel...\n\n1.  You can get samples of anything to take home or try anything out in the store.  And they can be very generous with their samples, too.  My boyfriend liked an energy splash but they were sold out at Christmas time, except the sample bottle.  So the fellow who was helping me filled a few sample containers for me to take home to carry my man over until they got some in stock.  Nice!\n\n2.  The Sephora brand products are reasonably priced, and offer a wide range of colours and fun packages (ie. Smoky Eye Effect, Angel Eyes, stuff like that).  \n\n3.  They carry a huge selection of other brands, from Clinique, to Bare Minerals.  Yes, they have a natural beauty products section, too, which is labelled separately.\n\n4.  The staff are knowledgeable, and patient.  They will try their best to find what will work for you, or wait while you dig through your purse for your customer card.\n\n5.  There are a ton of fun little items to stock up on, like cute nail files, pink polka-dot tweezers, kits for whatever you need on the go (eyebrows, nails etc.), hair clips, make up applicators, and everything else in between.  Great little stocking stuffers for the lady in your life, or for your bridesmaids presents kinda thing.\n\n6.  I am super sensitive to fragrances and for whatever reason this store doesn't bother me.  They must keep a lid on their perfumes and things because normally when I walk through a department store's cosmetics section, the perfume is so overwhelming that I nearly pull a Mr. Bean and crawl across the floor to escape it, while choking and sputtering.\n\nBonus - if you sign up for their card you get free gifts at either $100 or $500, and a free birthday gift!", "date": "2010-05-10 20:44:47"}, {"review_id": "EBHG6TJ-VBgjTC2gYNxaGQ", "user_id": "eH14jO2gDYdwizKaVH1ByA", "business_id": "iPapCIWs9BOTlamAhTDsIw", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Was looking for hand creme but after minutes of wandering around with no assistance I left.

She even went over my allotted time and did both my eyes (I had gone in specifically for eye make up), just so I wasn't walking around the mall with one eye done up.\nI'd definitely recommend Maura and hope everyone uses her services, I'm planning on going back for another consult with her in the future!", "date": "2013-01-24 15:21:07"}, {"review_id": "TsOmLjWo2HWmY2bt8u6Xbg", "user_id": "rk73ya6FQe7fL45cHPCfbA", "business_id": "ihYbIzIHFlFgLXtptKeQIA", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I just popped into Sephora during the last 15 minutes of my lunch break yesterday.

Ive spent atleast a couple of hundred dollars there in a year. There was one lady who was so helpful, and we would chat a lot. She was the perfect sales person with great service, and no pressure! Too bad she left since she was awesome\n\nMy bad experiences: Because I spent a lot when I was 18 and I was there a lot because of my breaks from work and my sick addiction to make-up they have accused me of stealing. I don't like being followed and I think most people don't, but when I feel your staring me down, and I have caught you following me Im going to be pissed. There was once incident in particular (Ive been accused like 3 times) where I was with my boyfriend at the time looking at fragrances, and a sales girl actually said in her headset \"I can't see what is in his pocket, but Im trying to look\" and we saw her say it in the mirror, so he flips out at her to the point I thought she was going to cry, and we left and spent money at MAC. There was another time where 4 of the employees were following me, and I freaked! I was about to show some receipts that I actually spend money, and I filed a complaint on sephora.com. Plus I worked right up the street why would I steal?\n\n\nOverall: I should give this place 2 stars, but I have a soft spot for Urban Decay, and Too Faced.

I asked her not to do that and she did stop, however, it should never happen in the first place. Service dogs are not their for amusement, they're their to do a job and employees should be able to remain professional and not be totally inappropriate when a service dog is on site. \n\nI then approached the store manager, Susan, to tell her that distracting a service dog wasn't ever ok and that it can put the handler in harm's way. I politely suggested that Sephora offer proper training around service dog etiquette to prevent these types of situations from occurring again. Instead of apologizing, she made excuses saying that my dog was too dark and that made her vest hard to see. She also stated that Sephora isn't legally required to train their employees regarding this. I have never had a bad experience at Sephora prior to becoming a service dog user and I feel that my becoming disabled has resulted in less favorable treatment and that's very concerning. \n\nService dog users are simply trying to go about our day and to do so we happen to use a service dog as an assistive device.

I have cashed out my remaining VIB points and will not be back again.  Keep in mind that I have spent thousands of dollars over the years at Sephora for any and all beauty needs.  I have been to this and the north shore mall locations multiple times and each visit ends pretty miserably. The customer service at these stores is abominable. I have gotten rude responses every time I have asked any question, as if my asking them to do their jobs is an inconvenience. Well I am done with that. This last particular experience was the final nail in the coffin.\n\nMy mum went in to purchase eyeshadow a few days ago and came home with a palate that was all matte and didn't realize. I mentioned this and that I would love to go help pick one out with her but our schedules were conflicting. So today, 8/6/16 my mum went in and was asked if she needed help. She said that she needed to return the palate and exchange it for a palate that has similar colors but with shimmer. The guy who worked there responded pretty agitatedly with: that one doesn't come with shimmer. And granted that's true my mum didn't realize and thought that the second palate did. So he suggested they go over to look and starts walking away from where the palates were and my mum said no they're over here and he said no they weren't. (They were where she was saying) but none the less she didn't know there wasn't shimmer in that particular shadow set but took it and walked away because he was very condescending and rude.\n\nFast forward 4 hours when I return to the store with my mum to get her what she really wants and it was awful. We walk around looking at a couple of palates my mum picked one she liked and we asked if they had more and the girl working opened the drawer and said no. So we start looking for other similar colors and make our way over to another section find another we liked and opened the drawer below to see if it was there as it was not stocked. (I realize now that this was a problem but since the last person who we asked just popped it open we didn't know it was an issue-- thinking along the lines of Victoria's Secret and their drawer system) well the manager (we now know that she's the manager) came up aggressively demanding to know what we were doing and what we were looking for (we didn't touch anything in the drawer at all it was just open-- still wrong but nothing damaging) and we asked if they had what we wanted and she pretty loudly goes, \"NO! I can order it for you,\" but we said no thanks and walked away. As we approached another section she comes back around and kind of sharply suggests she could show us something similar again and I said \"no thanks, we don't want your help.\" She looks over at another employees and says \"oh they don't want my help...\" In a demeaning tone. My mum hasn't said anything and already feels pretty awful from her first visit here today says something along the lines of you know you were just really rude to us so-- and the manager cuts her off and yells that she wasn't rude and that we were digging around in the drawers and that she can't have that. The entire store is now looking at us and we just walk to the counter to check out. I mention that I want to cash in all of my points and that I will not be shopping there anymore and the woman at the counter was very apologetic really trying to turn the visit around and even asked if we'd like to speak to the manager who is just right there, of course now we see the woman who yelled at us who was standing close by to hear what we were saying. We said no thanks she was the one who was rude and we left. \n\nNever again Sephora.

Sadly, over $300 in products later (the makeover isn't \"free\"; you must buy $50 in products), it was a huge fail for all three of us. My daughter washed everything off in the mall bathroom, and my sister and I just hoped we didn't run into anyone we knew. It was that bad.\n\nWe arrived 10 min early & bare-faced (as instructed), but our artists hadn't come to work yet. We patiently waited, sharing the looks we had found with each other. Yes, we brought pictures with us--just in case. \n\nWhile we were waiting, we were asked by 4 different staff members if we needed help. They were all clumped around the make-up stations, rather than circulating throughout the busy store. \n\nSUGGESTION #1: Distinguish customers who are waiting for a scheduled service from shoppers who need help finding a product so they can get on with their day (e.g., a cape like at the hair salon--or a badge/name tag of some kind). Better yet, seat us at an empty station and give us a $1 bottled water while we wait. It gets us off the floor & shoppers the help they might need.\n\nSUGGESTION #2: Tell customers to show up with their regular make-up on. This would enable the artists to sell customers on make-up remover, skincare, etc. while--and more importantly--allowing the artists to see what we're capable of doing on our own, what colors we currently wear, how we do our eyes and lips, & what we're doing wrong. It's only a make-up application--not a makeover--if we're starting with nothing on at all. I want to leave an artist's chair looking better than how I look when I leave for work in the morning. None of us did. \n\nSUGGESTION #3: Be consistent. All three of us experienced an entirely different makeover. My sister had 3 different people working on her--clearly confused about what to do with an \"older\" customer. (She is in her fifties, by the way.) She received a peel to brighten her skin. We were not even asked if we wanted one. (We would have bought one!) Two of us were asked for our emails & one of us wasn't. One of us had an artist who used a machine to match skin color to the make-up.  \n\nSUGGESTION #4: Instruct. Two of the three of us are seasoned make-up wearers. We watch the tutorials, already own the high-end products, & are asked by strangers how we do our make-up. (Again, the artists would never know this because they see us bare-faced.) So, the experienced make-up wearer is booking a makeover to learn something new. Two of us had very few interactions with our artists unless we asked questions. (On the other hand, my daughter's artist talked incessantly which was exhausting for all of us--including her coworkers who seemed \"done\" with her.)\n\nSUGGESTION #5: Invest in disposable eyelash curlers, since it's the  easiest way to make your eye pop is through curling the lashes. We were given one coat of mascara. One. Coat. And for sanitary reasons, no curling.\n\nSUGGESTION #6. Listen to the customer. Two of the three of us brought pictures. We left looking nothing like them. I said I didn't wear foundation right now because I have a tan. I looked like a clown when I left, with layer upon layer added to my skin--completely mismatched, removing my tan, and getting caught in every wrinkle and crevice in my face. It looked like stage make-up, nothing like the picture, & was embarrassing. I also described what I wanted for my eye--since I'm aware of how to make my eyes--my best feature--look bigger. After sharing that the make-up made my eyes look smaller, the solution to \"fix\" them was to cake even more concealer under them--making me look older. (For the record, I'm in my 40s & am not a wrinkly mess.)\n\nMy daughter looked ridiculous. She told her artist that she didn't want eyeliner or foundation. She was given both. And lots of it (not surprising if you saw her artist's make-up). She even had that I-just-started-using-foundation line at her jawline where her orange (!) foundation stopped and her real neck began. As aforementioned, she purchased make-up removing towelettes at checkout to use in the mall bathroom before we went to lunch. This was her birthday gift, and her makeover was a huge fail. She left in tears.\n\nMy sister, who wears just the basics for make-up, said that she wanted an easy, everyday look that she could do herself. Her makeover took the longest, & she looked the worst. Her artists (she had 3 different ones, remember) made her look like she was playing an elderly woman in the theater. Every single wrinkle was caked on with product, nothing about her face was dewy or rejuvenated, & she had next to no color on her face at all.\n\nThis was a huge swing and a miss. Never. Again. \n\nAt least not at Sephora.", "date": "2018-05-27 13:18:54"}, {"review_id": "g9iw8fPepeXqPRb04FkxGg", "user_id": "y2yDM1eGNPO9VyXF9unHwA", "business_id": "iPapCIWs9BOTlamAhTDsIw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Bruna took her time to take me on a wonderful experience.

The first associate was kind asked if I needed any help. With so many products, it was surely overwhelming to choose the right product. I have always been partial to one product that I've known my entire life, literally since I was 7 years old. Of course with hundreds of products around a technology developments, how do you really know what to choose? I asked the associate for an assessment, --what corrections do I need based on just looking at me with no make up. The first associate called for her colleague and her general response was, \"It's up to you\". \nUmm, thanks, well here are my concerns, now what can you recommend? I felt as those, she just pointed to what was next to us (me and my husband) and continued on. \n\nMy husband also needed a cleanser, as he a much different skin regime. Also feeling overwhelmed, he felt as though there were hardly any men's products. The one he had used before had just discontinued with the store. The sales associate showed us the only men's product available: Jack Black. I asked for more product information. Who is he? Is he the character/comedian? She said, No. Okay, What more can you tell me about the product? Where's it made? What's it known for? She was unable to answer anything at all, and had only told me that they have been carrying Jack Black for 10 years. \nLet's say, you go to McDonalds and ask the person behind the counter, \"What's a Big Mac?\" They answer, \"We've served it over 50 years.\" That does not describe what it is. \nAgain, that wasn't helpful at all and I felt as though that I had to do my own research with a quick Wiki look up. \nReluctantly, my husband just picked up the only thing that gear towards men and called it a day. \n\nI continued to explore more products and wanted to learn more about the Tacha products. The same associate came behind me and told me it was awesome and all Korean products are \"as I already knew\". Umm, excuse me? Exactly what did she mean by that? But, I digressed. \nI continued to ask, what made it so great? She vaguely answered, everything. I inserted, \"instant--\" she then finished a sentence. Instead of asking more to learn, I requested a  products to try them for myself. There was still something that I just couldn't quite trust about her or the Burlington associates. This particular associate had more of a tick/body language to push a product but was the least bit helpful and educational. \n\nThere was about an hour left to closing, but it seemed like they tried to push us out. These are the reasons why I love/hate Sephora. It's great to have the available products, but there is no help or guidance to choose what could be right for you.\n\nUpon checking out at the cash wrap, the associate there just doesn't seem to have any respect for packaging. She just jams all of your things into a bag and basically crumples up your receipt. Yes, they're just things. But, it leaves a very poor representation of yourself, your store when savagely stuff your customer's items. It's like when you put a soft loaf of bread and a gallon of milk in the same bag. Lady, what are you doing? \n\nAside from the greeting part, the entire buying experience at this store was just weird, awkward, and uncomfortable.

Today, I was followed around the store by blatantly obvious employees pretending to fix things where I was shopping. Hey, I may be in workout clothes, but I usually spend hundreds of dollars per visit on products and I might have today if I hadn't been so off-put by the service. Olivia, the cashier didn't even look up when I checked out. When I asked if there were any samples, she once again didn't even look up and flatly said \"I do not.\" No apology, no friendliness. I was really surprised by Olivia's response because in the past at other Sephora locations, if the cashier doesn't have any samples (which is rare) they ALWAYS apologize, and say that they'd be happy to make me a sample of anything in the store.  I love getting samples because I have very sensitive skin and have ended up buying many of the products I've sampled when they've worked for me. \n\nI think the bottom line here, is you can never judge a book by its cover and for that reason you should treat all customers with respect.

I saw another employee, so I asked her what she thought between the two - would she go with the flawless face kit which had more products or the BB cream: for the sake of looking most \"natural\" and saving time. She looked annoyed and pointed to the kit, \"Well what shade is that?\". I said \"Light\". She pointed to the BB, \"And this?\".. \"Uh... also light\".. \"Okay, go with this one\" and walked away. That had NOTHING to do with my question - and they're both the same shade so how she drew her conclusion is beyond me. I then picked my BB cream and went to the cashier...

I held off writing a review since I thought past incidents may have been isolated.  \n\nOn this- my last trip- to Sephora, I stood in the perfume area smelling scents to find a new one and received no help at all.  One associate asked how I was doing then promptly walked away.  After about 15 minutes, a fellow darker toned girl came over to see if I needed something.  I told her I wanted some samples to which she said the perfume lady was out but she would help me when I was ready.  I was ready two minutes later and went looking for her only to be redirected to the perfume expert on staff I was previously informed \"was on break\".  It was the same woman who said hello and walked away!\n\nSo I told her I needed some samples and she rolled her eyes, snatched the tester strips from my hand and began to angrily fill the samples.

Just to make sure her attitude wasn't just in my head, I tried to engage her by asking her questions on the notes in the perfume and comparisons to what I already have.

It went downhill from there though. \n\nI really needed help finding a foundation for my skin as I am extremely pale and have very dry skin. I also have a very red face and lots of pimples, so I needed something full coverage. They used the Color IQ to get my skin tone I guess (it didn't tell her or she just disregarded it, not really sure what happened) and searched the foundations for those recommended for dry skin. She just picked the first one that popped up and told me this was the one I needed. I was given no other choices. It was something I had never heard of and was very skeptical about. She didn't know much about the product except that it was apparently the only foundation that would work for me. \n\nAfter telling her I'd think about it, I started looking at some foundations I'd heard good things about that would be good for my skin. I asked the same girl who had helped me earlier if I could get a sample of the foundation I was currently looking at. She told me it would look horrible on my skin and I shouldn't even be looking at it and I needed to get the other one the computer recommended, which made me upset because I had searched through soooooo many reviews of that product and had heard it was really good for dry skin, but I guess she knows everything.\n\nShe could tell I was upset and she couldn't think of any other foundations to recommend so she handed me off to a different employee. This girl took me to two different foundations that she recommended but when it came to matching me for the right color so I could get a sample, she went on about how since my skin is red I'd need a yellow toned foundation to cancel it out. Yellow. On extremely pale skin. Also since when is yellow the opposite of red? But I digress. I told her I am going to be the lightest shade and that anything with yellow in it is going to make me look really orange. She continued going on about how I needed yellow and something darker, so I let her pick the shades she thought were best hoping somehow they'd match. Sure enough, when I got home and applied them, my face looked orange and way darker than my natural skin tone.\n\nI'm pretty frustrated with the experience and I don't like that they just rely on a computer to tell them what products to recommend.

But since a close friend of mine started working there I found out that this place offers so much more.\n\nPardon the confession, but growing up I always had bad skin.. I would struggle with acne and dermatillomania and used every over the counter acne product to try to get my skin clear and smooth.  I ended up making my skin look horrible.  Scarred, dried out, irritated and it got to the point where I hated looking myself in the mirror much less going out in public.  Even to this very day I shy away from photos or cover my face because of how much I still struggle with how I feel about how I look in photos.  I had become my own worst critic.\n\nI would use baby powder and talc to give my face a matte look because I hated how oily my skin was.  I'd steal my brother's tinted acne cream(which didn't match my skin tone at all) to cover up blemishes and scars, and would go to school looking like a touched up doll who's face had been dragged on the concrete.  Wearing hoodies, always looking down, having problems keeping eye contact.  Anything to keep people from looking at me. I hated my high school years and my early 20's. \n\nI mention these painful memories because I want people to know that everyone, not just women struggle with these issues.  Also to help break the stereotype that a store like this is only for ladies.  Looking back at how much struggle I went through, I realize now that I just didn't know anything about skincare or how let my skin heal from what I had done to it.  I saw my skin as the problem, instead of how I viewed myself as the problem.\n\nYears later, I walk into this Sephora location and got to know some of the staff in skincare and they shared so much knowledge with me.  It makes me wish I had known about this sooner because as a guy, we never really put much effort into our skin health which ultimately effects on inner health and self esteem. In my stubborn mind you were either you're blessed with clear skin or you're cursed with bad.  \n\nThey introduced me to several skin care items that not only helped clear up my oily skin but also how to start repairing the scars.  In time they started to fade and slowly I can see a healthier new face start to shine through.  I could feel my self confidence start to rise and I was excited to and happy to start taking care of my skin as well as what I put into my body.  Because of their help,  I am now a huge fan of the Algenist Skincare Line as well as Anthony and Dr. Dennis Gross skincare products.  There's way too many items to look at so I just stick with what care products work for me.\n\nI know many people go here to mask up who they are underneath, and I know that makeup is fun and exciting for people but I want to call attention to how much the staff really does care about bringing out the best in you, with or without makeup.  We call the shots on what we want, but sometimes we honestly don't know what we want..sometimes we just want to be or look like someone else.  And in truth that's not a healthy way to live, and I am glad they helped me see that.\n\nBut it starts with taking that first step in caring enough about yourself to ask for the help, and this team gives it 100%.  There was no judgement, no intimidation and lots of sincere empathy and care given to me. There's no judgement or criticism on who you are or the journey you've been through to get here and seek out help.  They just want you to walk with confidence and they have the goods and expertise to get you started on that path home.  They worked with me on what I could afford and allowed me to sample some of the other products to see how I like them.  The customer service experience couldn't have been any better. So my advice to anyone looking to start from the ground up in renewing their look is to simply to start with a great skincare advisor and work on rebuilding your canvas.  \n\nAll the products in the world can only do so much if you're not glowing from the inside out.  And the staff here can help you, regardless of who you are or what your story is.\n\nThank you for helping me face myself again.  The world sees us as we see ourselves.\n\nCheers!", "date": "2016-03-11 18:26:54"}, {"review_id": "XVDYKoz5hwQQVKIf6C3YGw", "user_id": "AFO5JbInMcpfUpDAWTvLDw", "business_id": "DUdFVKexLsd-BV1W7SGjJQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I'm 31 and work in hospital OR's.

But some high end products are non negotiable. \n\nI had a bizarre episode in the store a few years ago that really stuck with me, but generally their customer service and product selection is great.  This incident took place when I came in to buy some Dr. Perricone products when at the age of 22 I came down with a wicked case of what I can only describe as narcissistic hypochondria.  I needed a $598 bottle of face cream to rectify the damage life has bestowed upon me. Yeeaahh, growing up comfortably middle class and having my college paid for while surrounded by people who love me was really hard.  What idiots 22 yr olds are. \n\nI was helped by a sweet, slender woman who probably had grandchildren my age. She spoke with a Georgia drawl, had a meticulously sculpted mane of pale beige hair, and enough makeup to grant her a full-ride to the phD program at Clown University.  She showed me how to properly apply eye creams but she was so weirdly enthusiastic it kinda thru me off.  \n\nB/c I mentioned I wanted eye cream b/c I was tanning, she asked if I ever have tried spray tanning. I said yes but I just prefer to fake n bake. She puts her index finger up to my nose in a cutesy gesture that says \"I've got just the solution!\"  She lovingly takes my hand and leads me away.  She picks up a cylinder with an orange cap and tells me it's spray pantyhose. Mmkay? She tells me if I chose a darker color, it can be a spray tan but b/c the consistency  is that of pantyhose, it won't come off with my skin.\n\nWTF, lady?\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this.  For a moment a kinky Wall Street type with a fetish for body stockings I saw on Law and Order SVU flashes thru my mind. It being SUMMER in TX and all, liquid pantyhosing my entire body didn't seem smart.  BUT here's where it got  awkward.  Even after my obvious disinterest, she takes it upon herself to spray it on my leg, gets on her knees and starts to rub this stuff all over my calf and thighs. Having an elderly lady on her knees go to work on you like that is so terribly uncomfortable.  To make matters worse the pantyhose shade she chose was actually lighter than me so my leg was Michael Jacksoning right then and there.  And this stuff really does have the consistency of pantyhose and is waterproof.  A little embarrassed that it wasn't going as planned, she tries another shade, rubbing it onto my body with increasing vigor, only to make things worse b/c the layering was giving me a cadaver look b/c somehow they made gray.  Long story short (too late), I just bought this useless $30 bottle of pantyhose only to get this lady off my leg. The way she was working it she could be making a lot more money elsewhere.. I walked out of the store with one normal fleshtone leg, and one in rigor mortis shade. \n\nI've gone back a couple times after that weird intimate incident and saw her and quickly grabbed what I needed and left.  She doesn't work there anymore. Probably realized her true talent for unabashed stranger-rubbing and moved onto bigger better things.

I had ever been to a full sized Sephora, I had no idea this was there!! I had been going to that mini one in JCpenny for the last year, walking into this store was like a kid walking into build a bear. My heart stopped. \nEverything was very clean and beautiful, a very good example of what I expect from the Sephora brand. \nEvery single person I talked to, (which was probably everyone because I was there for two hours looking through everything!) were SO nice and incredibly helpful and seemed happy to work there. Even though I was there until 10 minutes to closing, everyone was happy. (I say that because I typically try to go places early because people are usually more grumpy at the end of their shift at most places, these girls still acted like they had just started their shift!) \nThe lovely perfume women who I VERY much wish I knew her name, I just feel so awkward looking in that area for a name tag so I couldn't even tell you if they wear them, she was extremely helpful and kind even though I took AN HOUR of her time. She was more than willing to help and even offered to help me again when I left and came back and was looking more at perfumes. \nI came in wanting Chanel no. 5, which I had never smelled before but knew it was an absolute classic that everyone raves about so it HAD to smell amazing, and was disappointed with the scent. It just wasn't for me. She helped me by asking what I typically wear and the smells I like, (which this was my first time REALLY buying perfume so I didn't know very much) and helped me sample a lot of different perfumes and told me the tones it it and about the brand. \nI was deciding between 4 different perfumes for about half an hour and I felt so bad, but high end perfumes are fairly expensive for me so I definitely didn't want to impulse buy and she seemed very patient, non pushy, and just very happy to be working there. \nIn the end I admitted to her that I LOVED one of the perfumes but I was worried that one of the undertones in it would make my BO smell worse/mix with it when I sweat. It was a beautiful scent but just not on me. She sprayed it on my arm to get a better idea and smelled it and was able to understand more of how they wear on me, and so she thought for second and suggested a similar perfume but with different notes, I believe that it was peony VS jasmine or something similar. \nThat perfume was Chanel Chance and I fell in love!!! We ended up going home with that one and I could not be more happy. Usually when you spend 100$ you're a mixed emotion of happy and nervous about your purchase, but after spending an hour with her and REALLY making sure it was right for me, I'm 100% happy. \nWhile we were there we were also able to have someone just quickly help me look for a conditioner for my frizzy dry hair that I'm trying to bring back, and a good moisturizer!!

I usually buy makeup at Walgreens, so for me that was a lot of money, but the product seems very high quality and it's supposed to last quite a while.\n\nI was a little worried that the color I got would be too light, or that the product might make me break out; however, I found out that Sephora has a satisfaction guarantee.  So, even if you've opened and used a product, you can return it.  Nice!\n\nAlso to the store's credit, I walked in with wet hair, no makeup, wearing the clothes I wore to clean the house, and they treated me really well anyway.  I'm sure I didn't look like someone who was going to make a big purchase, but a director greeted me promptly, and the sales girl spent a good deal of time helping me.

At least three of them were bright pink- which does not look natural on my olive skin. I asked for more colors and she came back with the Sephora brand lipsticks and finally had a better brownish color. She put it on my lips with no liner. My lips have a well defined shape that is easy to follow; i almost never put on lipstick but I can get my lines perfect every time. This woman put lipstick all over my mouth. Sure, she's not me and not familiar with my lip contours, but you should have enough skill to put lipstick on someone else if you're selling makeup for a living. I have no idea who decided to let her be a color specialist without making sure she knew how to apply lipstick. To top it off, I asked if the lipstick stayed sticky during wear. She said it would dry off and was a stain. I didn't buy it and said I'd wear it around a few hours and come back if I wanted it.  It stayed sticky for hours and I looked ridiculous with lopsided lipstick. I did purchase mascara that I had researched myself, but I will not be going back to Sephora for the lipstick I still need. \n\nKudos for the manager for asking if we needed help- she made sure my name (which was inadvertently taken off the \"Needs service\" list) was put back on.

Yes, you heard me right, I learned a NEW trick. If you have any grasp of the sheer quantity of makeup I own, you should know that I am the queen of contouring products. I literally collect and hoard highlighters and especially limited edition ones (one for use, one for pretties). Now to learn something new for highlighting? That's a big deal! There was a regional manager for Make Up For Ever in store and she was showing the artists unique tricks. My artist was contouring my nose because well, I have a very low nose bridge, and she said that if we used matte white eyeshadow the contour would POP. Man, she was right. I've never been so stunned. She added that I could add a regular shimmery highlighter of my choice over this white eyeshadow if I chose to do so, I chose to do it. \n\nThis place still rocks. The artists are experienced and really do try to listen to what you say. In addition, like before, they do carry the designer brands that I love. Their parking situation can't be beat but please note that most days they close at 7PM which can be pretty inconvenient. Hey at the very least, if you have questions about makeup you can always drop by and ask these ladies or you know, shoot me, your friendly neighborhood makeup hoarder, a message!", "date": "2014-03-12 00:57:27"}, {"review_id": "K4PHy6UQvvirKVM-SYYbYQ", "user_id": "kPPaKg29ouESThagBDbWyA", "business_id": "ev6F3cX4nI2P56fycg6oAQ", "stars": 4.0, "useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 7, "text": "Check it out...

I prefer these boutique types.\n\nI went in to Sephora with this list of my must haves (yes, I had to write down a list and you will see why):\n\n-Donna Karan Cashmere Mist Deodorant (try it, I cannot dissect everything I write about from this store because I would be writing for 50 years but if you have ever had deodorant issues, this will do the trick and can last a few months!)\n-Photo Finish by Smashbox\n-Kiss me Mascara by Blinc (I go between this kind, it tubes your lashes, and MAC or Lancome)\n-Ole Henriksen sheer transformation moisturizer\n-Perricone M.D. ceramic smoother for face\n-Sephora by OPI (HUGE bottle of nail polish for $9=awesome)\n-Frederic Fekkai Color Technician Shampoo/Conditioner\n-Small bottle of Lemon Sugar Cologne by Fresh\n-Benefit She-Laq (once you put your eyeshadow on, this will not budge)\n-NARS lip gloss in the pot (the best.  Ever.)\n-Cargo bronzer\n-Philosophy Margarita shampoo, body wash and bubble bath (all in one bottle)\n-Caudelie face mask\n-Dr. Brandt Crease Release\n-Make Up Forever eyeliner and a bright shadow, and false lashes\n-Amazing Concealer\n\nI end up leaving with most of the above but also some of the following and still want to try more from:\n\n-Urban Decay\n-Too-Faced glitter face makeup\n-Tarte lipstick\n-Stila eyeshadow\n-anything Dior\n-anything Chanel\n-anything YSL\n-L.A.M.B.\n-DKNY\n-Givenchy\n-Buxom Lips\n-Jurlique\n-Clinique\n-LaVanila\n-Boscia\n-more Philosophy\n-Du Wop\n-Kat Von B\n-KEVYN AUCOIN\n-Peter Thomas Roth Lashes to die for (look out, Brooke Shields!)\n-The Clarisonic Plus Skin Care system (I am getting poorer by the second)\n-Sephora Power Mask\n-Kinerase c8 Peptide\n-Dr. Brandt Lineless Lines no More\n-Dr. Murad Acne Treatment\n-Bliss Body Soaps\n-Sephora brand items like tweezers, nail clippers, etc. \n-the bazillion perfumes\n-Christmas sets will be out sooner that we realize....uggggh :)\n\nWOOOOOO!  So, when you walk into this wonderful place that can sidetrack you, just breathe, take your time, and I do advise going on a weekday rather than weekends if you really want to scope it all out. \n\nThis place is pure makeup and personal product magic.\n\nBeautify yourself by creating your own platinum-quality diamond encrusted train case stocked with the best things in life!\n\nWhen you become a \"Sephora Insider\" (they send you emails) you will get points for every dollar spent (which is easy to do) and you even get free items, sometimes.  I got a free Sephora brand lip liner.  The Sephora brand is great quality, and a good place to start if you are not used to wearing makeup.  You also get nice samples when you are an Insider.\n\nSephora, as a store, deserves every star.  \n\nThey will let you sample items, too, just ask.\n\nWhile the prices may seem high, you really get what you pay for here, and these items will last you for months!!!  I can only go here a few times a year just because I do not want to be wasteful and it can get costly! \n\nThey have a great return policy, too, so do not feel stuck with anything (just return it promptly).\n\nOne thing that slightly bothers me, though, are their contests.  I have entered at least 12 of their contests, even sending them a S.A.S.E. like they say to in order to get a list of winners and they have never ONCE sent my S.A.S.E. back.....so I am wondering who is winning these Sephora advertised contests.  ???\n\nIf you have not been to Sephora, and you like makeup or being girly....this IS YOUR PLACE!!

Each and every time I went, even first thing in the morning, the store was a pigsty. The floor was filthy with dust and hair bunnies tumbling across my path. Displays were out of order. Grossed out? Yeah, me too.\n\nMost of the staff ignore me most of the time. I typically get a \"hello, do you need anything?\" after I've shopped for a good 30 mins and my basket already has stuff in it. It would be really nice to have someone say hello upon entering the store, which they do in the US.\n\nI can think of only three instances where I wasn't ignored from the get-go. The first was to tell me they were closing (yeah, thanks). The second was to match my foundation using the nifty new face match gizmo they just got in. This was genuinely a cool experience.\n\nThe third time was downright hilarious. I couldn't find a basket, so my arms were overflowing with stuff. I was poking around the Tarte display, and one of the staff comes up to me and starts talking to me about the product I was looking at and proceeds to grab my hand and draw on me. \n\nAll the while, things are falling out of my arms and onto their (dirty) floor. Didn't ask if I needed help and didn't ask for permission to touch me. Didn't clue in that I needed a basket. I told her I was very familiar with the brand and didn't need a demo, but would love a basket. She said \"oh\" and walked away. I never did get my basket. I ended up stuffing things in my pockets and my handbag for convenience, which I'm sure drove their loss prevention people nuts.\n\nThe cashiers are usually very nice and get the line moving quickly, which is always appreciated. Returning things can be a circus. The cashier asks the reason for the return (fine, no problem), and then the manager asks the same question when they're approving the return.

I'll never be an everyday makeup sort of girl, but I wanted to have the skill and knowledge to create a great look for when I needed one. Sometimes a girl just wants to look amazing, you know? I finally decided I wanted to be able to do that, too. \n\nEnter Sephora, with all its wonders and treasures untold. Over the course of this year, I have purchased all the things I would need to create said kickass looks. I got a foundation that matches my skin tone, a powder, a few eyeshadow palettes, an eyeliner or two, a highlighter, blush, and a few new lipsticks. (Obviously, I bought a lot more than that, but you get the idea.) I now own nice makeup and I'm pretty decent at putting it on my face in a pleasing manner. Next year's goal? Perfect eyeshadow blending. Who am I? I never thought I'd be that sort of girl and it is happening. Can't say I'm complaining, though. \n\nI've learned a lot from Youtube, my friend who has a makeup collection to end all makeup collections, the Internet, and the ever so wonderful Shannon. Shannon is basically my favorite employee here because she is so helpful and patient. (Not that the other employees aren't helpful, but I usually get Shannon and she is amazing.) Shannon helped me create a bridesmaid look for my sister's wedding just based off an approximation of my dress color. She never tries to sell me a ton of products and she gives honest recommendations. If she thinks the best product for you is only $20, then that's what she recommends. I love that because then I can make my tiny makeup budget stretch further and get the most for my money. (And she does not recommend bad products, y'all.) Shannon helped me find the right foundation, helped me find some skincare items, and taught me a lot of tricks. I really can't thank her enough. \n\nI'm definitely not the best at makeup or looking glamorous, but it's nice to know that whenever I get the urge to look my best, I can just stop by and someone will graciously offer to help. Who doesn't like looking and feeling beautiful?", "date": "2015-12-15 16:29:41"}, {"review_id": "Jq7zTqrvJyXyUrrBURNeig", "user_id": "aLlzE9FdwuOqo8XjrX7clg", "business_id": "DUdFVKexLsd-BV1W7SGjJQ", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Absolutely enjoyed my latest visit!

Mainly because the young lady I worked with was incredibly sweet, and she is truly a hard worker. Although I need to voice my experience. I went in on March 6th,2015. I had booked a Makeover to have my make up done for my friends birthday party. I must say when I got there I was attended to quickly and the young lady began my makeup. The first issue I had was prior to coming in that Friday I had filled out a little application on their site, stating exactly what kind of makeup I was looking to have done. I honestly didn't see the point of even filling out that small application considering the makeup artist didn't even look into it. Anyways, moving on, she began doing makeup and honestly she was doing a great job, explaining what she was exactly doing. I felt that she understood the look I was going for, for that night. Further into getting my makeup done, she asked another makeup artist to place false lashes on me, since she was still learning how to herself. That was perfectly fine with me, the second issue was the fact that the second artist placed the lashes very, very horribly. She didn't put mascara on me prior to adding the false lashes so there was almost this gap between my natural lashes and the falsies. It was very noticeable that I had them on. I personally thought once she added the eyeliner the overall eye look would look better. It unfortunately did not. I'm no pro at eyeliner myself but given the tools she had, the eyeliner was very sloppy and uneven. Thankfully enough I had a smokey eye done, so not everything was noticeable. Once I finished I payed and I left. Now the biggest issue of this entire experience was what occurred that night of the birthday party. When i saw my significant other that night I of course greeted him with a kiss and a hug, later to realize that a good chunk of my foundation had been transferred all over his mouth, ,his nose and his face. I was mortified!! Thankfully he took it in good spirits and laughed it off but I was afraid to hug or physically interact with anyone else. I personally will never have my makeup done again at this location, being that the experience and the after math were so horrible. The young lady who attended me, bless her heart, but it was obvious her experience was minimal.

And I am NOT usually a harsh reviewer.\n\nI usually wear very little makeup, just mascara and lipstick.  I am a fair-skinned redhead; unusually for a redhead, I tan, but have freckles.  I wanted my eyes done for my daytime outdoor wedding-- nothing too dramatic, but maybe liquid eyeliner and some false lashes.\n\nIn my opinion, a makeup artist should\na) listen to what the client wants\nb) ask questions if the client isn't clear, or if the makeup artist doesn't understand\nc) try their best to do what the client wants, and if they really think it's a bad idea, communicate that; and \nd) try to be gentle (physically) in the application of the makeup\n\nAnthony at Sephora was apparently not on the same page regarding any of those expectations.  I set up a run-through appointment, to be followed by him coming to my house the morning of my (morning) wedding to do the real deal.  He said the cost for this would be $150, which was more than I wanted to spend, but hey, it's my wedding.  So I emailed him at least 4-6 photographs showing the eye look I wanted.  \n\nWith picking up family at the airport and delayed flights etc, I had to reschedule the run-through to the day before the wedding.  He was very flexible and good about the rescheduling.  I came to Sephora for the run-through with a friend, and explained again in words what I wanted--\"I do not want any help with my skin or my lips; I don't want to wear foundation, powder, or concealer.  I already have my lipstick-- I just want help with my eyes.\"\n\nHe remembered my photographs (all were Angelina Jolie) and told me to shut my eyes.  He began by spackling my face with a wet brush, quite vigorously to the point that my skin was being pushed from side to side.  I had to press my lips together to keep my mouth closed, and needed to squint to keep my eyes shut when he was close to my eyes. \n\nThen he started \"pouncing\" his forefinger HARD against my under-eye area and even on top of my eyelids.  It was so hard, I began to flinch and open my eyes, moving my head to the side and said \"ouch!\"  Hoped that would communicate that he wasn't being gentle, but he was too busy regaling my friend with tales of his makeup services to Marie Osmond to pay attention to me. \n\nAfter a thorough application of powder and a brick colored blush (Brick?!? on a redhead?!?!)  he asked me to open my eyes.  I looked great, if I were going to be on TV.  Say, an episode of \"Dallas.\"  But I had no more freckles, and the immaculately perfect expanse of skin was more like a mask than myself.  He began to decant samples of all the products he'd used to create this new skin, saying to me that he'd bring them all with him the next morning, and I gently laid my hand on his arm and said no, you don't need to bring any of that, I really don't want you to do anything but my eyes.   He said Oh, okay... and then started on my eyes.\n\nI'm sure you get the point.  I'll summarize by saying my eyes ended up beautiful, if I were going to have dinner by candlelight in late fall.... lush, sparkly peaches and velvety terracotta colors, with very smokey smudged brown crayon eyeliner and no false lashes.  Very not \"pale and sparkly lids with distinct narrow dark liquid liner and dark lush lashes.\"  Very not like the photos and very not like my description.  Very not appropriate for a morning wedding and a backyard reception.  VERY NOT WHAT I WANTED.\n\nThen, even though I said I already had my longlasting lipstick picked out, he asked me what kind of lip I liked.  I said medium pinky-peach, but not nude.  So of course, I got a nude lip, with so much glossy goo that my hair seemed magnetically attracted to my mouth.  I can tell you that would have lasted about 3 seconds at the wedding.  \n\nI bought an eyeshadow, paid him the $150 he wanted, walked out, wiped off my face, and spent the rest of the day trying to decide if I was smoking enough crack to have him do my face the next morning.  I went back and forth (I'm not good with firing people) and called him finally about 11:30 that night.  (That sounds bad, but he had told me he was spending the evening doing a fashion show, so I felt I couldn't call him and fire him via voicemail.)  I explained why I didn't want his services.

I have never been what you'd call a \"high maintenance\" kind of girl, and to be honest, places like this terrify me!

No one ran up to me attacking me with mascara and concealer, and I was free to explore around to get my bearings without even a single judgmental look from one of the staff members (I hope you're paying attention, Ulta employees!). And when I did need help, help was to be found!\n\nI was looking for two products in particular, and the woman who helped me (I wish I had gotten her name!) was super knowledgeable. Her educated guesses about what I wanted were spot-on. Once I told her that I have oily skin and really care about buying exclusively cruelty-free products, she steered me in the right direction towards those products and helped match my color to the foundation I wanted. She also gave me recommendations about other product lines I might be interested in trying that were in alignment with what I was looking for. Her opinions were straightforward and I didn't feel like she was trying to make me buy anything I didn't want. I also felt comfortable asking her questions and didn't feel at all like she thought it was something I was supposed to know already because I'm a female.\n\nI left that store with a tremendous sigh of relief.

Plus, the brand launch was a very sad one. There was a limited selection and the display was dismantled once the event was over.

This left the other employee giving everyone else 5 minute sessions after she realized spending 20 mins on a person with 5 other customers lined up for their turn was not going to work for an 1.5 hour event. She subsequently went on her break too when the older employee returned. The employee did not mention what products she was applying so I had no idea which items I liked or not during the mini facial. It seems like they were hoping to just do one or two facials total before the event was over. There are four chairs in the skin care section. I do not get why they did not have four employees working so that more customers could have the opportunity if there was no talking involved.\n\nThere was a goodie bag (more samples) at this event if you spent $60 which I was fine with. You could order products online at the counter to qualify for the goodie bag during the event. Once again, this was a rouge event. To be rouge status, you have to spend $1000 annually.

She denied it ever existed!  I had two products in my hand that I had questions about. To the staff who were following us around and watched us without asking us if we needed assistance, clearly you need to ask for more training.

The return process took more than 10 minutes. Nobody asked me how my experience was and why I wanted to return the items after 5 minutes of purchase. The manager (middle aged white lady) was beside this cashier the whole time and did not seem interested in returns, or customer satisfaction. The cashier went on the mic to ask for assistance on till 2, because she is \"handling a customer concern.\" So it turned from a return to a customer concern, without the sephora staff feeling concerned for my dissatisfactory. Now how are you going through a customer concern without asking me what the problem was?! It was a complete waste of my time and I wish I never came there. Straight up, I would not recommend anyone buying makeup from Sephora.\n\nSephora, you need to train your staff more. There are other places we can go to but you are near and convenient to us. You need to know that your staff is treating customers based on how they feel about them - the status quo - and not for the willingness of helping others. I will be posting my experience on other sites and review blogs, as well as the BBB to notify this locations lack of professionalism and would recommend more training to understand consumers and how to deal with customer complaints or customer satisfactory. \n\nYour staff judges people based on what they are wearing, how much or how little make up they have on currently, and race. Now I know I won't ever go back. Ladies, you do not need to keep giving your money to these corporate bitches that do not care about the product you're bringing home, as long as you make them look good! I hope this review helps you understand what is currently going on in 2017 at this Surrey location, and I truly hope they get the proper training they can receive for the success of their location. \n\n**** I highly recommend Sephora staff/managers contacting me for more information, this is NOT the first time I had a bad experience but I WANT to make a better difference to what my review means to your company. Train your staff to treat humans like beings instead of credit cards & you will see the difference in how customers react to that type of generosity. Why do I need to make a review about how you should treat people!? ****", "date": "2017-06-22 18:18:57"}, {"review_id": "IBS6RGjs5iWdp8hKAN5vVQ", "user_id": "MNjwzg4s_H0IdK4C08FfZQ", "business_id": "Cwa0hZYFYKYF6Z6wr9QAmg", "stars": 2.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I've had always enjoyed different selections.

Plainly put, there's a lot of fucktards who work at Sephora. \n\nI only get helpful, genuine, sincere service 10% of the time here, from a very small handful of staff. Last time, there were at least 17 employees (lost count). Three were at the cash register, two at the entrance to greet people, and perhaps 4-5 were really helping other people. That leaves about 7 people to be available to help if anyone needed it. \n\nFirst off, no acknowledgment whatsoever when I walked in. Ummm, isn't that your job, greeters at the door?! Even when I walked by the greeters several times they did not smile nor did they ask me if I needed any help. \n\nAfter standing in an area for about five minutes trying out different colors, I can see at the corner of my eyes three staff talking to each other at the end of the aisle no more than 4 feet away from me. I know they see me.

Not one of them helped. On occasion, when I refuse to leave without buying a product because I sat in 30 minute suburbia traffic to get here, I hunt, flag an employee myself. But the majority of the time, I leave because I don't like tolerating shitty service. \n\nBut I've been here enough to get what's going on. You either need to cake on that makeup, so you like your performing on Broadway, or going clubbing, or some kind of YouTube makeup guru. Or, you fall into the 14-22 demographic. OR, if you happen to be older than 40, you get helped if you look like a country club wife. BTW, did I mention that if you're a woman of color, you most likely won't get helped? I noticed that with other customers of color. \n\nThat leaves the rest of us. Professional women, mothers, aunts, etc. who are willing to spend loads of money on quality products.

I asked if she would call customer service for me, she said no, I asked if I could use their phone to call customer service (I left my cell in the car) Nichole said \"no, I could not use their phone!\" By this time I was pretty upset. Went out to my car and called Sephora customer service. They were shocked by the way I was treated and called the store for me to talk to the manager. The manager was supposed to come out and speak with me, so I went black in the mall. When I got back to Sephora customer service asked the manger in charge, penny i believe, to come out and speak with me but penny, Nichole and another associate stood at the front entrance  giggling saying they aren't allowed to leave the store!

Where you could try on samples and educate yourself based on how the product felt and looked on you instead of listening to a spiel about how it is supposed to work in theory.\n\nSadly, those days are gone. Sephora is now milling with said brand \"consultants,\" i.e. hired sales reps from various brands that will aggressively interrupt your shopping experience to drag you to their display. These reps are inconspicuous as they do not identify themselves as working for certain labels. But if you look closer, you'll notice that they do not sport the Sephora uniform but rather wear everyday, unbranded clothing. \n\nMy experience at the Great Hills Sephora started by spending about 10 minutes at one of the makeup displays looking for foundation - no harassment. However, once I selected my foundation and entered the skincare section, I was Daniel in the lion's den! Not even 60 seconds into checking out one of the skincare lines, a sales rep approached me and I kindly (and curtly) let her know I was just \"browsing\" - a.k.a \"leave me the hell alone.\" This kept happening about every 3-4 minutes with different sales reps. The sales pitches became more aggressive the longer I stayed but I continued to politely defer engagement with them. These individuals were hired by the following brands: 1) AmorePacific; 2) Laneige; and 3) Sunday Riley. (Thanks to Google, I just learned that Laneige is owned by AmorePacific.)\n\nIn all three cases, these brand consultants attempted to stop me from exploring the line I was originally interested in. All three brands are new entrants to the product mix at Sephora, and are using aggressive sales tactics to increase their exposure. The rep from AmorePacific slathered moisturizer on my hand and sprayed me with toner without asking my permission - I expressed no interest in her line but she brought those products over to the section in which I was standing. The sales rep from Sunday Riley literally took one of the products from the original line I was interested in, out of my hands and put it back on the display, telling me authoritatively that it would not work for my skin. The rep from Laneige asked if she could show me another line without even asking me any questions about my skin. Trying to be open minded, I agreed, followed her to the Laneige section, and listened to her educate me about the line. As I was checking out the display afterwards, another sales rep hired by Laneige brought two other unsuspecting customers over to the Laneige display within a span of 3 minutes with the same spiel - and all of a sudden, it started to make sense. \n\nSephora is obviously ok with the customer experience being interrupted by these vultures. Unfortunately, after being a loyal Sephora customer for 20+ years, I've made a decision to NEVER step foot into another Sephora again. A department store beauty counter would be a much more relaxing experience. (Never thought I'd say those words). Ultimately, I ended up buying multiple products from the original skincare line I was interested in, and ZERO from the others. (pat on the back to myself)  :)\n\nThe big takeaway here: UNLESS THE CONSULTANT HELPING YOU IS WEARING A SEPHORA BRANDED UNIFORM, BE WARY.

So I was surprised when they were opening up a new location.  After doing some research, I found out Sephora is trying to roll out a smaller-store concept with a focus on curating an experience for the customer and pushing their studio services (i.e. free makeovers and mini-facials). The place is about half the size of a regular Sephora. \n\nWhat I liked: the workers I came across were friendly. The girl who rang up my items was pleasant to deal with and wasn't stone cold like some other employees I've encountered at other Sephoras. Also, for a small store, I was surprised to see they carry most brands I buy at other Sephoras; the store selection wasn't as lacking as I imagined. \n\nWhat I didn't like: Because the store is so tiny, it was difficult to navigate around the store. Blame opening day hype, but this location is in a high traffic area, so I foresee this to continue being an issue. First of all, there are no registers. I get they are trying to make the customer experience more personal; so whoever assists you on the floor is supposed to ring you up on a tablet (located at various areas around the floor). The girl who originally assisted me didn't ring me up because I wasn't finished shopping. So when I was done, it took me a few minutes to figure out where the \"check-out\" was. There are also displays of makeup right next to where people are making purchases. For example, I was trying to look at a display of makeup in the back of the store, but there was a line of people blocking the items because they were checking out. Furthermore, sometimes it is confusing to figure out where the \"line\" starts and ends because there is no dedicated register. People get distracted looking at makeup while waiting, for example - I don't want to inadvertently cut someone. \n\nI don't fully understand the concept. All the services they are trying to push - the free makeovers, etc - I've seen those at other locations. I think I read you can get a longer makeover here (75 min, according to what I read vs 45 min); however, I don't think they really offer enough added incentive to make it a truly unique concept. I really felt they were trying to cram what I see at the Prudential Sephora into about a quarter of the space. \n\nIn short, good selection and friendly employees, but the supposedly unique customer experience left something to be desired.

It's green tea, light wood, musk and trails with a floral. Really interesting, but you have to be a bit daring to wear it. \n\nMasaki Matsushima M - A fairly well balanced scent that has a light base of musk, no wood, but like all of Japanese scents, something different. Good for casual everyday wear.\n\nKenzo Peace - A complex, almost confusing scent from the generally reliable Kenzo. While it surely has tonka bean, which throws it off track really, there is a surprising absence of patchouli, (for a hippie scent) which might of settled it and gave it cohesiveness. Perhaps layer it with your favorite patchouli from some place like Kiehl's?\n\nKenzo Parfum D'Ete - This opened up very promising, with it's rich floral and unidentifiable green stuff, I thought perhaps vetiver. But after it's dried down, the smell is much less complex and it's definitely not vetiver. But the floral are ok. The search for a definitively feminine vetiver continues. But this is maybe another layering possibility?\n\nThe newer Guerlain's were dissapointing as was the Gucci Eau de Parfum, a pity, since the men's was so good.", "date": "2008-08-20 20:00:40"}, {"review_id": "JswGUuZuV2vJoyuhKjXCqA", "user_id": "W2X292sVEs87kOopGppRww", "business_id": "Kgu_yATyELIGMjI6Bgsiog", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 1, "cool": 1, "text": "Don't get me wrong, I love Sephora.

But I did get a free 15 minute facial by a salesperson who was really attentive and knew her stuff. I noticed during my facial that there was some training going on in the skin section, so the sales people really take their jobs seriously and are prepared to answer any questions that come their way. I was definitely sold on some products and left with more things than I went there for. To the point where I may have to return a few things because I had no impulse control.\n\nSo basically this location would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the parking situation and the store's layout.

First of all, it is always PACKED. No fault of their own, but even at noon on a Tuesday they're busy. How can they fix this? Uhm, hire more salespeople! Not a hard equation to figure out. And what makes things worse is that the salespeople that they *do* have seem to be more interested in their own makeup than tracking down the perfect plum lip color for me. Lame-o. I have made laps around this location that creep up in to the double digits without being helped, whereas at other locations I am greeted almost immediately, nearly hounded. And not to stereotype or anything, but I could understand the cold service if I was some pre-teen who obviously isn't going to purchase anything and just wants to play with the makeup. But no, I spend serious cash here, and I expect a little lovin' in respect. If not I'll just make my way down to Bloomingdale's and spend my money there. \n\nToday, however, was a downright mess. I had a rather large return due to some emotional shopping a while back, and I'll note here how thankful I am of their lenient return policy. However, when I'm returning something, I don't need the attitude. I've never received so many dirty looks before, even from someone who appeared to be the manager! If you don't want to have to take stuff back, don't have a return policy. Then, to add insult to injury, they gave me cash back since i paid with a debit card. Kinda weird, and no big deal, until the cashier started counting out the money: all in small bills (at least 30 ones). And yes, a rather high amount of cash.\n\nSo thanks, Sephora, for the great makeup. But I think I'm going to stick with another location or the department stores from now on...

I must say that every time (and I'm not exaggerating... EVERY SINGLE TIME) I shop at the South Shore Plaza location, there is ALWAYS something that I wish to purchase that is not in stock.

The color / variety I wanted was not in stock.  Same thing last night.  I was looking for a specific color of spray-on glitter and that, too, was not in stock.\n\nI mentioned this to the clerk who agreed that this happens far too often in this location.  In fact, she even opened a drawer where they keep the \"extra\" supplies, and showed me that they have loads of the other stuff (which I didn't want), but none of what I wanted.  \n\nAnd, to agree with another poster, the displays are all messed up.  When I was looking for a copper color of the glitter I was looking for, I looked behind the \"try me\".  It was the wrong color.  So I thought it was a one-time mix-up.  Nope.  When I looked behind the \"gold\" glitter, it was also wrong.  When I looked behind the \"original\" colored glitter, it, too, was wrong.  If I had simply trusted the display and picked up what I thought was what I was looking for, I would have been really pissed off at home!\n\nI also agree with another poster about walking a few feet down the plaza to Nordstroms.

It takes all of my self-control not to walk out of there with armfuls of products, especially the Philosophy bath stuff. \n\nBut I'm writing this review based on my first (and definitely not my last) visit to the new store at Cambridgeside. I stopped in recently in search of a new face cleanser. As I was perusing the different products and about to get completely overwhelmed by the options, I was approached by the nicest salesgirl. After explaining my dilemma to her, she asked me some questions about my skin type, the last products I used, and eventually directed me to the Caudalie line. She demonstrated the products for me and was even able to offer a personal recommendation about one of the products she was showing me. She was so incredibly helpful and nice, not to mention extremely knowledgeable, and I had such a good experience with her that I ended up buying all of the products she had recommended, not just the cleanser (for the record, they all work great).\n\nThe store is organized well, although the line system can be confusing at times (which really is a problem at all Sephoras). It's also on the small side, so while I could spent a good hour browsing in other Sephoras, I'm done browsing here in about half an hour or so. But the customer service is unbeatable. While the Sephora at the Pru is bigger, it was often like pulling teeth to get a salesperson to help me.

I'm new to the world of makeup and 2.)I'm a college student. 3.) I have dark skin, so the Struggle is REAL when it comes to finding the right match. That being said, I came to Sephora in hopes of finding powder/foundation that looked as natural as possible. When I got there I judged the \"make up artist\" due to her questionable makeup. I went along with it anyway since I was already there and figured I'd wash it off if I hated it.\n\nShe tried Cover FX and did me up. Throughout the whole process, I kept reminding her that I was a college student on a budget. Somehow, I ended up paying $70+ for three items. It looked great in the store (studio lighting), but once I stepped outside I realized that I had a ghoulish tone (not cute). Needless to say, I returned the powder and the ridiculously priced lipstick today.\n\nI was still hopeful, so I asked if they carried Make Up Forever since a friend with similar skin tone recommended it. The cashier sent me to a rep up front who looked at me like I was an idiot for not knowing anything about skincare regimes and make up. She kept telling me my face was dry and it took all that was in me not to tell her that her face was caked up and shiny, so I'll take dry any day. \n\nThe first color she chose was wrong, so I asked her if she had anything darker. I guess she felt offended, because she went on to explain that she had been doin' this for years and blah blah blaaah. When she came back with the right color it was perfect and that shut her right up. The last girl applied everything for me, but she just handed me the sponge and kept calling me \"sista\". Just because I'm black and natural, doesn't mean I'm your \"sista\" ma'am. \n\nThe best thing she did was recommend me to the skin care professional (who also had on questionable make up, but was helpful/personable). She kept my budget in mind, didn't pressure me to buy anything,gave me samples of all the lines and encouraged me to do some research on them. I noticed that you get better customer service if you look like you have money (which is expected since it's bougie @$$ Lenox). She stopped a couple times to help someone else mid consultation.

I have been a loyal client at the Sephora Lenox Mall location for about a year. Usually, someone always greets me and assists me with finding the products I need to find. However, today I had a difficult experience. I walked into the store around 5:30 p.m., and was not greeted by anyone. I looked around for the product I was trying to find for a while, and couldn't find it. I finally walked up to two sales representatives who were having a conversation and asked about an Estee Lauder brand. The sales representative kindly showed me the Estee Lauder collection that they carried. I then asked about finding a full coverage foundation, and was directed to \"a top matching foundation\" sales representative. She asked what skin type I had, and I told her I had oily skin. She applied a Becca primer to my skin which very noticeably got rid of the oil. However when she was squeezing the bottle to get the primer out, she carelessly squeezed a lot of product all over her hand. Next, she got a bottle of foundation from NARS and had difficulty getting the foundation out of the pump. She accidentally and carelessly squirted foundation ALL OVER my new Vince Camuto pants that I had just purchased from Macy's. She then apologized and I said how are you going to fix this. I had a date that I was attending that night, and the pants were expensive (ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT I WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT BUYING DESIGNER PANTS). At first she said we could try to get it out with make-up remover, but then didn't want to assume the responsibility if it didn't come out. After talking to her manager, they offered to pay for my pants to get dry cleaned. I was then upset, panicking and in tears because I had specifically bought the pants for my date. I said I didn't want them to pay for dry cleaning, because what if it didn't come out. I said I just wanted my pants for the night. The manager KINDLY WENT OUT OF HER WAY to walk me to Macy's, and then offered to buy me new pants. Unfortunately, the store was out of my size. Then, the manager gave me store credit, for the amount the pants costed before tax. She also included a complementary free mini make over for my date. THIS LOCATION IS A GREAT LOCATION!

I can think of a million things I'd rather do than go to a mall. So, when I do have to go, I make a point to always stop by Sephora because it's my own little version of heaven.\n\nThe staff is really friendly. I don't understand the reviews claiming that they couldn't find associates - Benefit cosmetics ALWAYS has a representative available, and I feel like anytime I switch sections (from hair to perfume, for example), there is someone there asking if I need help. If they're out of a product, they check with the other Austin locations, or offer to special order it for me. I've had my makeup done here twice before parties, and the skin prep girls and the makeup artists are so incredibly friendly and so fun to be around. The cashiers are sometimes a little frazzled, but it really doesn't detract from the experience. \n\nThe fragrance section has to be my favorite part of Sephora. I have an obsession with perfume, and am always trying to find new scents for different occasions. I love the fragrance finder, the abundance of paper strips to test them on, and the coffee beans available to refresh your olfactory senses. I love it. \n\nI'm a sucker for cute packaging, so the line to the register always gets me, because they have all their best selling products in mini and sample sizes. It was great during the holidays, because they were the best stocking stuffers (okay, soooo... it was my own stocking, but who cares!). Join the Beauty Insider program. Every dollar is a point, and you can choose to redeem your points either at 100 points or 500 points. I've found some great new moisturizers with those samples.

I visited this one on a Saturday afternoon, and it was pretty crowded. I was looking for a new lipstick to try, and I had an idea about what I wanted (a purple/red). All of the staff were busy helping customers with makeovers or other questions. I could not find anyone available to help determine the best shade for me, but I had plenty of time to try shades on my own. :-) \n\nSephora usually carries a nice mix of colors and brands, and this store was no exception. Plenty of shades to try, and I found something I liked from the Sephora Collection. The coordinating lip liner selection was less than I expected: there were few shades available in full sizes, and several testers were missing. However, when I was checking out, the cashier (Scott) suggested a mini Sephora liner in aubergine, and I decided to give it a try. He mentioned that particular color goes well with most Sephora red/berry lipsticks. \n\nWhen I brought the liner home and opened it, though, the tip had been smushed, and was basically gone. It was disappointing to see a brand-new product like that out of the box, but I fixed it easily with some sharpening. The lipstick (Crush 23) and liner are perfect together. I wish I could find it in a full size, but I think that color may only come as a mini. I might look for something similar from a different brand, when it runs out.\n\nFour stars because I found a new lipstick I enjoy, and because Scott seemed to know just the liner shade to match. (Before shopping I read some Google reviews of this store, and he's gotten kudos there too. The compliments for him are well-deserved :-) ).

This is possibly the worst Sephora you can go to with some of the worst customer service you can endure. I don't know who is training these ladies, but they should really learn some customer etiquette. My first visit here was to try out some skincare products and just browse around and read descriptions. I understand that the ladies are there to help, however coming up to a customer and telling them that they don't know what they're doing isn't really enticing to your customers in any way. I was immediately turned off to browsing around any longer. I've just given them another opportunity to show me that only one of the ladies is ignorant enough to tell their customers that they don't know what they're doing, however apparently their strategy is to criticize their customers in front of their faces in order to sell you something. I can guarantee you that no one who is criticized will want to purchase anything from you. I was testing out a lip liner to go underneath my OWN lipstick to see if the colors compliment eachother. I did not ask for help. I did not ask for anyone's opinions, yet one of the ladies who worked there who's name is VONDHUS took it upon herself to watch me apply my lipstick, and not only did she stand there for a while in my own personal space, but she also decided to say, \"that's a whole lot of lip, and they look so incredibly dry.\" That is understanding if she was going to offer me a remedy for my dry lips (which are dry because Atlanta just endured 20-30 degree weather, and usually when someone has dry lips they can see that for themselves, so there's really no need to point out the obvious), however she just gave me a rude opinion for nothing. I don't know how anyone thinks that's good customer service, but I guarantee you that it's not. I don't care how well you apply makeup, that's not how you talk to your clients.

I'm usually content enough to turn down offers of assistance and just wander around and browse.  \n\nHowever, on my last visit, I actually did want some assistance.  And when I asked for it?  I was soooooo disappointed.  I told the first girl in the store the two things I was looking for and she got kind of flustered.  Concealer and eye cream, people, is it that hard?  So she says so-and-so can help me with one and so-and-so can help me with the other.  This complicated hand-off is arranged where I will go off with one guy and then come back and find this other girl and I'll be set!  I think, well maybe these are the two experts, maybe this will be okay.  \n\nSo this guy takes me back to the eye cream section, I tell him what I'm interested in, he grudgingly points out a few products.  Three products.  This is Sephora people!  I want to see like eight, at least.  My favorite part?  When he mutters \"let me know if you have any questions\" as he is WALKING AWAY!  Yeah, you care a lot about my questions, dude.  \n\nSo I pick something out, wander back to the rendezvous area to meet up with the concealer chick.  And I don't see her anywhere.  I see a lot of girls (employees) giggling and putting tacky make up on someone else.  I can't tell if any of the gaggle is my concealer girl, but I'm already annoyed enough so I wander over to perfume.\n\nThis is the only place I get any decent service.  This girl was wonderful.  She finishes up who she is helping and then turns her full attention to me.  I've been looking to try a new perfume for a while, but it's hard.  I don't want to blow $50+ on a bottle I'm not sure about.  But she is so patient and helpful - I tell her what I use now and she does a great job picking out some scents that I probably never would have tried.  (Yeah, I pick by looking at the bottle...not always a successful method.)  Most of them I liked and a few of them I REALLY liked.  \n\nTwo super awesome things?  I had a pile of paper perfume sticks from all the testing - they had gotten mixed up and i didn't remember which was which.  I picked out the three I liked the best and she totally identified them!!  I mean, I know it's sort of her job, but after all the perfume huffing, i would have thought the smell detectors would have been dead!  So, I found my three favorites and then i got SAMPLES of them to take home!!  Yay!!!  Do you know how much more confident I am about buying a $50+ bottle of perfume when I can actually try it on and wear it for a couple days??  So happy!  \n\nSo, in summary, 4/5 people I dealt with that day at Sephora sucked and were not helpful (or even that friendly).  The woman in the perfume section was wonderful (and she even helped me find concealer too so ha!).  HOWEVER, Sephora's sample policy is AWESOME and I love them for that.

When I went to Paris, I visited perfume houses and museums. I go to Aedes in NYC. Making perfume would be a nice hobby for me. i can do that thing in Silence of the Lambs where Hannibal Lector tells Agent Starling what body wash she uses at night. Not really, but I can ID a lot of stuff.\n\nBut if I were to steer you girls (or men) into picking something for your man (or girl), here are my choices out of the men's section.\n\nGuerlain's Vetiver - The oldest of the bunch, it's primary note is of course Vetiver. It is a minor classic from 1956 from the most established house in the world. Vetiver is an exotic grass from asia I think. I love it, it's somewhat \"my\" smell, neither citrus not flowery, herbacious with enough deep notes to forego a wood base. The bottle was resigned in 2000 and it is now green in color, where as before it was yellow. I have a semi-vintage bottle which is a bit stronger I feel than today's version. I have another Vetiver from a small San Fransisco outfit called Elizabeth W. and it is an awesome vetiver. Sweeter and sexier than Guerlain's classic.\n\nGucci's Pour Homme (first edition, brown) - This is simply awesome, they took vetiver and gave it a *good* sandalwood base, and added some outrageous top notes, such as black pepper, papyrus, ginger, oris, plus some amber and leather to finish the low-end. Extremely powerful and unique, the best new widely available fragrance in a long long time. Don't pick up Pour Homme II by mistake. My favorite at Sephora.\n\nKenzo's Tokyo - Very simliar and less strong than Gucci, it is also a vetiver-wood mix. They've jazzed it up with ginger, some citrus which wears off quick, shiso, cardamon, green tea, mate, pink pepper, and others. If Gucci is simply overpowering, but you like it, go for this they are basically the same. I'm wearing it now and it's gorgeous.\n\nGendarme and Gendarme's Sky - A long time specialty fragrance not widely available, this was made by a person who had allergies to most perfumes. As such, it does have a light touch and smell. Perfect for the office or anyone who is perfume intolerant. Sky is new and I would categorize it as one of those sport type perfumes, but much gentler and tolerable. \n\nEverything else was pretty much disgusting or very very typical. For laughs,  I tested Sean Comb's perfume, it was simply the worst piece of garbage since Paco Rabanne. Prada's first entry is somewhat different Labadium flowers with some other unusual things with a touch of pauchouli, very on the edge of femininity. Tom Ford smells very old fashioned, and aside from Guerlain, there are no true perfume houses represented, they are all fashion brands hiring Aramis or another contractor to do the dirty work.\n\nCan't really comment on the cosmetics and don't have the patience to test the women's perfume section. But stick to Guerlain and Annick Goutal. \n\nAnyone serious will head down to Aedes de Venustus, see my review.\n\nSephora, or \"S.E.P.H.O.R.A.\" -  Scents Etc.

I'm fine at filling my brows in but I'm not extremely comfortable doing other people's makeup. Then she says okay there's a 45 minute wait for that. And I was like uhhhhhhhhhhhhh wtf? Okay. I filled in her damn brows myself. I did a good job. I didn't need to ask actually cause I did them perfect. But that was stupid. Then they were sold out of it.

I am not even taking about day of release, I am taking products that were released 2-3 weeks earlier.

This annoyed me so I preceded to tell him the names of all the palettes and where they should actually be. My friend was with me and started lauighing and told him that he shouldn't argue make up with me. He wanted to prove me wrong so he opened up one of the boxes and sure enough, it did not match the sample. At that point he was pretty embarrassed and said something about it in his headset. Apparently someone had reorganized it earlier in the week to put out some new products and she must have messed it up.

We are also those introverted people who find approaching staff in shops distressing. \n\nSome wonderful people took us under their wings. Sure, it's their job, but for the first time in my life, somebody took the time to \n1) find the right color foundation for my skin tone\n2) explain why they made the choice they did \n3) explain how foundation color works\n4) what colors I should be looking for in eye shadow and blush and why\n5) why I should avoid silica based products and how to tell \n6) put these things on my face and teach me how to reproduce the results \n\nSami and Arturo were god sends. Not only did they help and teach us, they were incredibly kind. They didn't make us feel bad for just how bad we were at figuring anything out, and were personable, to boot. We had a fantastic conversation with Arturo while he \"fixed\" us. The folks at the check out counter were lovely as well and we had a delightful conversation-- even though we had kept the staff well past closing time with our dithering. I can't praise the staff of this store enough.

I'm actually inclined to giving them one star, however I DO want to recognize the friendly cashier and the friendly manager that I was offered too speak to after a very rude employee attempted to have me scolded. Lol! Really, this was so surreal. Also, this is one of the biggest and nicest looking Sephora stores that I have seen. Too bad I don't feel like visiting it again. But first, let me explain...\n\nSo, I have a product to return and I call to this Sephora store before actually getting there in order to confirm that it's a store, on it's own, and not inside of JCPenny.  I confirmed the information and drove to this location. I was excited since I don't know of many Sephora stores that are not within a JCPenny (besides the ones on touristy malls such as Florida Mall and the Millenia Mall. \n\nAs an excited yelper, I noticed that this store does not have a business page on Yelp. I had to locate it through their website... So as most Yelpers would do, I decided to create a business page for this store. \n\nI create it and take my time in front of the store adding the store hours. I feel (or see with my peripheral view) an employee looking at me, but I'm guessing she is eager to provide customer service once I'm in the store.  So I go into the store and take a quick picture of the left side of the store...\n\nThe watchful employee comes speed walking toward me and says, \"Excuse me, you can't take pictures of the store. That is not allowed\". I was surprised and replied, \"Really!? That's odd. I've never been told that at any other sephora stores.\". She then says, it's store policy. I explain to her that I'm a Yelper who is just adding their business page to Yelp and she said, with a shrug, \"only corporate is allowed to do that\". However, she did say I could take pictures of specific products, just not pictures of displays. I was still surprised, but apologized and thanked her for the information.\n\nWent to the register, returned my item, cashier was a friendly guy who was nice and completed the transaction quickly. Afterwards I walk toward the perfume section, to check out a perfume I'm interested on, while remembering that I can only take pictures of the product. So I grab my phone and put it in front of the perfume, as closely as I can (since it's on a high shelve) and take a picture.  Guess what happened?\n\nThe watchful employee comes almost sprinting (I exaggerate, but she did speed walk) toward me and raising her voice from across the room saying, \"Mam, I told you you cannot take pictures of our displays, do you ned me to call the manager?!!\" I wait for her to finish and to arrive to where I am and I said, \"I'm sorry, I thought you said I could take pictures of a products... that's what I did. I can show you the picture... \"\n\nShe then proceeded to say that I could take pictures if I had the product on my hand (all while walking away from me) and \"asked me\" if I needed to talk to the store manager. I say \"asked\" me because she didn't even wait for me to reply and went to get the store manager as if though I'm this kid who is in trouble and she is telling on me.\n\nStore manager arrives, her name is Faith and she verbalizes, \"Hello, I was told you asked to speak to me.\" I let her know that I did not request to speak to her, although I appreciated her taking of her busy scheduled to talk to me. However, since she was there, I explained the situation I was having with the rude employee. She explained the whole policy and seemed dismissive of her inappropriate employee. I showed her the pictures that I had taken and she said they were \"ok\". She did not apologize for her employee but did say she would talk to her, since I mentioned that it was \"beyond me why her employee was so upset, raised her voice and treated me with disrespect\". \n\nManager later encouraged me to visit again (not sure about that happening any time soon) and thanked me for my patronage.  Embarrassing much? Yes! Unnecessary and uncalled for?  TOTALLY.  Being a frequent \"flyer\" at the Sephora on Florida Mall and having always been treated nicely and with respect, I can say I will not visit this store again and would rather travel to Florida Mall or Millenia Mall.", "date": "2017-11-27 20:02:17"}, {"review_id": "vPZV42ITMPSibnMpBkdW6g", "user_id": "3IU4N6ymVaJvUpRmobM5fg", "business_id": "y8S7UrYz4_J16OLLg5qGsg", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 2, "funny": 1, "cool": 0, "text": "Hello Yelpers!

She then told me about a promotion of the points, and before I let her finish I told her again, I'm Rouge, I know everything! (A lot of times before people in the store know due to my BT presence). \n\nI then stepped away and heard every single conversation that she had with girls around her asking them to sign up for a BI card. Or even \"Can I help you with something? No, I'm just browsing. Ok, did you want to try this? No, just browsing.\" Like very pushy. Some people may like, I personally hate pushy people.\n\nI wanted to buy some hair things but after being around her I remembered my last experience and didn't want to spend money at this store. I picked up my pencil sharpener (which I knew was on sale and the lady didn't, as there were no signs), and went to the line. There were about 4 or 5 associates talking amongst themselves, and only one girl at the register. Makes sense. I wait and get a turn and talk to this \"I-hate-my-job-and-you-can-see-it-on-my-face\" kind of look. I had already put my card close to her for payment and she still asked me to pay.

I'd rate Sephora as a company five stars, however this review is for their retail location that I just visited. \nI visited the mall this evening with only one purpose: to go pick up some products at Sephora versus buying them online and waiting a few days to receive them. \nAs soon as my husband and i walked through the door, we were greeted by an employee. Said \"hello\" back, then we headed towards the brand that I was looking for. This is when my experience turned negative. \nAn older male asked if I needed help with anything, to which I replied \"no thank you\". The employee stayed on the other side of the display and literally twenty seconds later asked \"you still doing okay?\" Again I didn't take him up on it, just thought that they were really focusing on customer service or something. I walked to another display while my hubby browsed through some colognes, and the same employee moved directly next to me, pretending to straighten up some product and again asked me if I needed help. For the third time in under maybe two minutes I turned his help down. I moved to another display and he literally followed me again and pretended he was facing product. He waited thirty seconds, and then asked for the 4th time if I needed help. At this point it pretty much confirmed it-this dude is being really \"helpful\" because he thinks I'm here to steal something. \nSpeaking as someone who has worked 11 years in retail, most jobs tell you to provide \"extra\" attention to those who might be stealing. Pretty much to try to make them uncomfortable and leave. Usually you size the person up based on their behavior/appearance.

Here's the cool thing about Sephora, when you spend above X amount of dollars with them in a fiscal year you gain unlimited access to their beauty studio (and salon if your store has one). What this means is free full beauty consultations and makeovers and hair styling (again store permitting). This is a great deal because if you're not of this spending class you have to spend $50 minimum to \"pay\" for the appointment. In addition once you've reached this class of customer, all Sephora stores are required to give you priority booking over other clients when you need to get in for a makeover in a pinch. They are also required to have 5 spots minimum held for these clients/day. \n\nSo, like I said, while it's a significant amount of money to spend on Sephora, it's worth it. Keep in mind, this is money you HAVE to spend at Sephora. Sephora doesn't carry any TF products or any of the truly high end skincare lines (read sisley, la mer, la prairie). However while I like having a makeover done by the TF makeup artists, they seem one dimensional. Sephora on the other hand can do any look you request be it over-the-top crazy or super classy (neutral eye, bold lip). \n\nThe thing I like about this store and the reason for my upgraded review is that they have ALWAYS accommodated me for makeovers. Even in less than an hour's notice they always try to find some way to squeeze me in. I know it's because it's part of their policy to cater to certain clientele but I still really appreciate how they will shift things around and take a certified cosmetician off the floor in order to make sure I'm happy. Not only that but these makeovers seriously make me look phenomenal... I may have makeup skills but I'm not a professional (maybe just a professional makeup/skincare hoarder!). \n\nSo, is this place awesome? Heck yeah.

Returned to same sales woman who had paper towels in hand - she offered no help. Asked for a bathroom - directed upstairs - no assistance to locate. Cleaned off the liquid makeup as best as i could, returned to floor -asked for business card - told they were out.

Long story short, after doing my own research through the trash folder of my email, I found my original confirmation.  I mistakenly signed up for the class at Perimeter Mall instead of Lenox.

Keep in mind you should always, always disinfect the tester and apply with disposable applicators, doesn't matter what you are trying on, but nothing gross me out more than testers with hair(yuck) in it and sometimes the quality of the testers all depend on how busy the locations are and therefore how much time they can spend on ensuring cleanliness.  \nTheir beauty studio has good lighting as well due to the windows which is a must for trying on complexion products.

Support your local Sephora employees because they will make you your best self. \n\nHelpful hint: parking is hit or miss, park in front of Dillard's, the second floor side and chuck a left through the store and boom, heavenly chorus of angels singing, there is happiness to your left.", "date": "2018-11-04 01:30:59"}, {"review_id": "knf-EaFOPpApYaAEwoL7rg", "user_id": "xtsDQYvsLydJgTUO9ebtBw", "business_id": "2nV35Pv00G1FzF754iY1kg", "stars": 1.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "Really tried multiple times to give this location a try. From the moment you enter the store you are treated poorly. I'm not sure if I'm disappointed more because of the lack of service, or the fact that you are on Disney property and leave the store feeling anything BUT Disney magic. Arrogance isn't cute, and the cluster of women standing in the front loudly talking about clients is downright appalling. Heartbreaking to know that this location continually misses the mark leaving the consumer disgusted after spending are hard earned money!

Today my cousin & I went in to purchase a Fenty beauty foundation for her & from the moment we stepped in to the store, we were being followed. It is extremely uncomfortable to shop while you are being stared at by multiple employees & even hearing one of the employees say on her head piece to CHECK THE CAMERAS ON FENTY. We both felt harassed by the employees because they would come up to us every 5 minutes to ask us if we needed help. We knew exactly what we were going in for (we even knew her shade #), we don't need your help especially if we declined the first time. One of the employees (which seemed to be a manager) was hawking us, watching every move we were making as if we were going to steal. When we later when to the Laura Mercier station (which is close to the exit) a security guard was posted right behind us. My cousin did a swatch on one of the Fenty glosses & when we were paying at the register the same manager came up to us & asked us why we didn't take the gloss & where we had put it back? Seriously? It's where we found it, lady. I was highly disappointed tonight because I understand it is 2 days away from Christmas & it's total chaos at any store but there is absolutely no reason to be blatantly humiliated. I have never had a problem previous times I have visited this location & have indeed spent hundreds of dollars at the location too. I was even more disappointed after reading other visitors reviews who experienced very similar behavior from employees. Terrible.", "date": "2018-12-23 06:13:48"}]
