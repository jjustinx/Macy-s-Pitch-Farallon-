I recently went to the store to return a pair of boots for a client of mine who misread the size.  My client had removed all tags and had no receipt for the shoes. This client is low income and was given a gift card in order to purchase the boots.  With no proof that the boots actually came from TJ Maxx, I was not expecting a lot of help but decided to try anyway. The manager of the store was so patient and listened to the whole story of what had happened. She searched the store high and low for similar boots and ended up giving me another gift card for the value of the boots. Because of this manager, my client will be able to purchase winter boots that she desperately needs. The manager could have very easily dismissed this situation and claimed there was nothing that could be done.  Instead she went out of her way to solve the problem and help a Brookline senior stay warm this winter.

If you were shopping with a teen, it'd be a breeze to keep your eye on them. \n\nThe fitting rooms were clean, had lighting that highlighted every pore on my face (eek), and the fitting room attendant was by far the best employee in the store. I was using a cart and she put a sign on it to prevent someone from taking it while I was in the fitting rooms. Other folks weren't quite as helpful. The girl at the jewelry counter's compliments (pushes for me to buy an item) were so fake, it was hard to listen to. I asked someone where the carts were and she wasn't remotely helpful. My cashier asked me where the tag was on the shirt I was buying. How was I supposed to know? Instead of calling someone over, he had another cashier do it. I requested a tag which was done promptly but at that point I was itching to get out.

The registers are swift and they have a little bell that goes off and a nice ladies voice says \"Register Four is now open, please proceed to register four.\"  The ladies that work there are nice.  There was one lady who gave me a good deal on a black Michael Kors shirtdress, that probably retails for $200.00, I got it for $59.00, as there was not a tag on it.

These shoes have very white soles and when I purchased them, all were slightly dirty and my assumption was that people try them on and walk around a bit in a store that has floors that are not super clean. Not a big deal. The bra I picked in a hurry happen to have a broken strap that had been tied back, so back it had to go. When I made it to the register, I was told that the bra and the white sole shoes were not in sellable condition and therefore I couldn't return them. I explained that that's exactly how they were sold to me and that I had not noticed the broken strap, but all the tags were on plus the sticker on the bottom of the shoe was pristine. In fact, my daughter tried the smaller pair of shoes first and didn't even try the pair I was returning because it was obvious that they would've been too big on her. Those didn't even make it out of the bag! The manager went as far as to tell me that that sticker wasn't printed at that store (???) perhaps implying that I had somehow printed it myself. What made me really mad was their terrible attitude and the comment regarding the price sticker, which baffles me since that particular pair had to have a sticker printed in case I needed to return it (it didn't have one for whatever reason). All in all these ladies made me feel like I was lying and trying to get away with returning something I had worn, a very uncomfortable feeling when you are surrounded by other people. They reluctantly processed the return, but made it sound like they were doing me a favor. Their attitude towards me at this point was also very hostile. Needless to say, I won't be going back unless it is absolutely necessary, which is a shame since I have been a loyal costumer of that particular store for over a decade since it's a mere 2 blocks away from home. I wish I had thought of bringing a pair of the same shoe from their racks so that they could see how they looked just like the pair I was returning.

To be fair, I wasn't hunting for anything so I could have been oblivious to some lucky \"finds.\"\n\nI'm giving this store 4 stars as opposed to 5 because I did have an odd interaction with one of the staff there.  My first encounter is when I was taking a photo of some beautiful, gourmet cooking pots/accessories.  I was actually taking these for a friend who was shopping for these items.  As I took the photo, one of the staff told me she did not want in my \"selfie.\"  Huh? I was pointing at the pots AND she was no where near the photo angle.  I shrugged it off and went to another aisle.  Well, she came down that aisle and walked in front of me like I had irritated her saying \"I'm sorry, I have to get my work done ... I don't work in an office.\"  Whaaaaaa?  I hadn't said anything and I was just looking at planters.  It was downright WEIRD.  Again, I shrugged it off as it was just that odd and headed over to the pet area.  Well low and behold, she came over to that area so I dodged her as I didn't want to get in her way!  These interactions actually cut my shopping trip short since I wasn't sure what was happening and didn't feel like browsing any longer.

Two pillows and a dish-set. She says no, I have to take them with me, she can't watch them.\nAgain, I tell her, a half thought while I go into the room and try my items, and she declines. She snaps at me \"Can't take in underwears!\" \nOne, if I can't leave my bads, how am I supposed to know I can't take in another set of clothing I want, if you don't even let me leave my bags out there. \nI take my clothes and my oversized shopping bags in with me, try on what I want. I go back with the clothes I want and the pants I don't, and put them where they belong, the rack. The woman snaps at me to go back and get the clothing tag. The tag, in addition to the giant bags I have, and the clothes I just put away.\n\"With what hands?\" I ask her.

They of course didnt find them. They opened the boxs- i didnt even open them! 2 of them were MISSING GLASSES!!!!. one was missing from the champagne flute box and the other was from the wine box. Thanks for letting me purchase something that wasn't full and that i coudlnt return. Fix your f*cking return policy. They manager was a total jerk.

So I always just take my cards in pocket or wallet alone.  Well today when shopping, I saw the manager (fair skinned black male with curly hair) straight up harassing a borderline elderly woman as she was leaving the dressing room because she allegedly had fewer items than the number on the card she was given.  She showed him her purse, her dressing room...he still stood there accusing her of trying to steal something in spite of her having nothing on her hidden from plain view.  Short of an all out strip search, I'm not sure how else she could've proven she wasn't a thief.  She was a much older woman and clearly embarrassed at the whole ordeal and trying desperately to prove in any way she could that she didn't do anything wrong.  How about this possibility Mr. employee-of-the-month:  maybe your dressing room attendant miscounted and gave her the wrong number to begin with?  Mistakes happen.

Housewares, cookware probably the best section. \nOne star,or less, for the disgraceful customer service.\n\nThis week, I selected a pair of winter flannel pajamas that had been marked down with a red tag to $12, from an initial Maxx price of $24.99.  I waited in line.  The cashier was unfriendly from the beginning - did not make eye contact with anyone, did not greet customers. A little off-putting but ok, it's not a fun job, and you don't know what's happening in somebody's life.  But then the exchange got worse, a lot worse. When she rang up the item, the $12 charge appeared. The cashier then appeared to notice some other marking, and without explanation, left the register in the middle of the  transaction, and spoke the manager. When the cashier returned, she flatly announced that the price was $24.99.  I did not purchase the item.    \n\nIf the item was mispriced, that was the fault of TJ Maxx.  More importantly,  both the cashier and the manager were uncommunicative to the point of being borderline rude.  The manager did not speak to me at all, and simply stood there and delegated the duty to her cashier.  Neither offered any explanation, or gave any expression of  \"I'm sorry, \"  etc.   (As it happens, next door at Marshall's,  the same item was red-tagged to  $15, so that  $12 price was not some wild, unrealistically low price).   When I  then asked, at the point of (non) purchase, what had gone wrong,  the cashier shrugged and said she didn't know. \n\nBy now, I was confused and a bit irritated. Once I got home, I contacted the TJ Maxx customer service number, and after they spoke to the store management, the phone rep left me a message that someone -  \"not necessarily\" me -  had switched price tags.  Well, thank you for the crumbs from your TJ Maxx table (\"not necessarily\" !) , but I didn't switch any tags.   The store  management should have offered some  explanation of the different price point, with a degree of apology, for the confusion and the inconvenience, right when I was at the register.

I couldn't get access to or see the jewelry in the display case, as the friend and the sales gal wouldn't move. There were a few other women near me who were also trying to see what jewelry was in this case, with no luck. The saleslady was oblivious to us all. None of us opted to disrupt the conversation between the two women; it seemed to be personal and involved.

I haven't had much reason to shop here (as a kid, I despised TJ Maxx because my mom would periodically drag me to one and I'd be bored out of my mind). Over the last 12+ years, when my mom has visited me in Atlanta, she's stopped by this store. And my significant others (past and present) have shopped here too. This TJ Maxx is located at The District at Howell Mill just off I-75 exit 252.\n\nMy fiancee's carry-on roller bag broke so we came here looking for a new one. As soon as we entered the store, front and center on display were some black, 20-inch, Samsonite Pallant spinner (four-wheel) bags that I thought were ideal. She wasn't as big a fan of them as me, but I liked them. They were soft, lightweight (less than eight pounds) and expandable, had both top and side handles, and multiple pockets/compartments. The price was $79.99 each which I thought was reasonable (regularly $130, I believe). There were only two so I grabbed one while my fiancee looked around the luggage section to see if she could find anything better. She couldn't, so we got it. The only thing I didn't like about the bag was it felt a little cheap and flimsy.\n\nMy well-traveled and savvy mom found a better bag online at Macy's with next-day pickup available at Lenox Square. It was a 21-inch Delsey Meteor spinner for $86.99 (regularly $250; I think they took advantage of some sale or offer or something). This model was available in different colors which my fiancee liked. She ended up choosing Midnight Blue. She did not like the boring black color of the Samsonite. Like the Samsonite bag, the Delsey bag was lightweight. However, the Delsey bag was higher in quality, from the extendable roller handle to the wheels (they were good and strong). Overall, the Delsey bag looked nicer too.\n\nWe returned here the next day to return the Samsonite bag. We noticed that the other Samsonite bag had sold also.

Sheet sets are priced usually with $10 increases per size. So there they were same sheets and I had decided to buy a set in honor of Kate Spade (twin $29.99; full $49.99 (mismarked); queen $49.99). I knew the full set should be $39.99. I stood in a long line to ask the customer service rep (Rebecca) who very quickly and saucily ignored my issues completely. NO she said. These are correct prices. There was another sheet set that I had seen in the clearance section without a price tag. The sheets were all balled up in a plastic bag and the zipper was torn, disconnected from the plastic. They did not look fresh. BUT she said \"item is not damaged, so they are not discounted\" as she prepared a price tag for the package and pushed them all balled up back into the plastic. It was a little absurd. Rebecca, I hope you are reading this, and can recall the rudeness of how you treated me, and how you likely treat other TJX customers. So the next day I drove to another TJX and yes, there they were, the full set of sheets for the correct price $39.99.

But let me tell you, positives about TJ Maxx, so you will understand why I did that:\n1. Their Credit Card, you don't need to spend 2,000 points to get a $20 Nordstrom Note.  You get 200 points to earn $20.  How about them apples!\n2. Yesterday, I was looking at one brand @ Nordstrom, petite (since all of their pants are made for 5'9\" women, the petite were perfect for us shorter women. When the clerk @ Nordstrom came to asked me, how was it, I told her \"these pants were something I'd wear for jogging, but their not for business, and I'm very disappointed!\"  I've bought many dressier pants @ TJM for half the price they're selling @ N, and I was quite satisfied!\n\nBut, those are just the two on my list. I'm sure there's more, I just don't want to write comparing TJM vs. high end. That's not what this review is all about!\n\nHere's the negative part:\nLEATHER JACKETS Made in India. No MATTER what brand, that I ordered in the mail as long as they're Made in India, they're all the same. I ordered several online, in various prices, colors, brands, styles, in my size. I was gonna keep 3 of them, but the smell was giving me a headache.  I returned them all, and decided to go ahead & keep one jacket.  (I've worn & bought Made in China, Italy, Australia jackets or locally made in the USA for 5 decades, I KNOW my LEATHER).  I let that leather jacket air outside, in the garage, in the porch, in the backyard, and brought them back inside, and the smell was quite strong, it was still giving me a headache.  I did that for the last 2 months, it is getting better, it is still not worn, but this is my only NEGATIVE about Made in India leather sold @ TJ MAXX.

These TWO produces were stacked on top of each other--and BOTH had those $2.00 Red Tags on the front of the package. The ONLY difference between them is that they were different colors. (One pinks one peaches).  \n\nAt the checkout counter one of the tags mysteriously fell off the front of the package in front of the cashier. (A dull teenage looking gal with a snarky attitude to match). She immediately went into \"check the price mode\" and pretended to engage a store supervisor \"by speaker phone attached to her shirt and then a headset\". It was all fake. She wanted to beat me down about charging $5.99 for something that was on the Red Tag Discount rack. I pointed out the facts: It was tagged, the tag fell off at the cash register, the were stacked on top of each other in the same exact location when I found them.  We went back and forth on the fact that I should have been given the discount. This under age clerk even went so far as to say that the $2.00 Red Tag didn't even have the same serial numbers !!!!

No more driving out to the suburbs to bargain hunt.  \n\nI have to admit that after scoping out this location a couple of times over the past few months, I still found it difficult to locate it exactly in the Office Depot complex on Sixth & Alder.  There's a block or more of flags fluttering from windows, so I thought the store was actually near the flags; no, far from it.  It turns out it's in the basement portion of the building.  I then had to decide how to get into the basement to get to the store.  I finally figured out it was the elevator.  It was not until I left the store that I saw that one could use the escalator in the Office Depot store to get to TJ Maxx as well.  So, my first suggestion to the store is to find a way via signage to point out exactly where the store is located, otherwise it is surprisingly tricky to find. \n\nHowever, once you get into the store, it is bright and well organized with a nice selection of goods that TJ Maxx is well known to provide.  I thought it looked an awful lot like their sister store, Home Goods.  I'm not sure about needing a greeter (especially when you see the greeter, having nothing else to do, shaking her booty to the Muzak as you leave).  Stores with greeters make me uncomfortable at best.  I just like to walk into a store and get down to business without having to greet someone back (yes, I know, I sound like a crank, but I do like to focus and shop, and greeters distract me from the task at hand).  Prices are outstanding as usual, and it's always so much fun to poke around and see what's available and what surprises the store has for me to find.  \n\nIt's all to the good until it's time to check out.  The area on the way to the checkout line was so crowded with goods that I could not find out where I had to queue up.  They actually had to have a \"checkout greeter\" to guide most of us into the correct place to get into line.  That kind of rattled me, but they had a good amount of checkers to keep things moving along quickly.  My cashier was friendly and helpful.  \n\nI will come back to be sure now that I've trained myself to find the store.  I can't stop loving you, TJ Maxx.  You're one of the few stores that can throw me for a loop and still keep me coming back.  Good luck in your new location, but I think you're going to make money hand over fist because I think the downtown shopping crowd is going to love you to pieces.", "date": "2012-10-19 06:57:36"}, {"review_id": "ow8gqWGxnNtm2uB8aex26g", "user_id": "qizx7ktA-cwJj2XYnJFcsA", "business_id": "pidBg1kT_xXo8MFCclhQYQ", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 1, "text": "When shopping at TJ Maxx, you have to go in with the right attitude. If you are there to do something quickly, or to have a fancy shopping experience, you are going to be disappointed.

I also have gotten $10 men's leather winter gloves. Also $20 comforters/blankets, etc. $5 Timberland 3-piece baby outfit. $40 Born Clogs. There's also some high end lingerie if you are willing to pick through the racks. The list goes on! \n\nBasically, you have to shop patiently and carefully. The kitchen and home section is really quite good. I always try to stop here before buying sheets or kitchen stuff elsewhere, because the prices just can't be beat. The lighting isn't the best, but no one ever tried to pretend this was a luxury store. The dressing rooms are all the way to the left sort of where you come into the store.

The other costumers...mostly downright rude. People, please be kind. \n\nSo we're all here to get a good deal, but at what price? No seriously, what price? Half off?! Snag that thing you all of the sudden urgently \"need\" and have been missing out on all of your life! Push and block anyone else out of the way trying to get it! Just kidding on that last part, but that's how I felt shopping here. \n\nA cart (hopefully one where all the wheels work this time) is certainly needed on a TJ Maxx/Home Goods run. How else are you going to carry all of your new treasures around like a stock pile until you get to the cashier? While a cart is a necessity, there doesn't seem to be an easy way of traveling around the store with one. Most people seemed to be unwilling to share an aisle. The moment you move over for someone or get out of the way to look at the thing you desire, someone else gets territorial on you and you are now blocked from existence until they are done. This part can become exhausting when it happens to you repeatedly. \n\nMy grudge is obviously not the fault of the store (or maybe it is because they have such low quantity of high quality with low prices causing much demand?). I just hope people read this review before going to this location and remember we're humans and not vultures. \n\nMy best advice to anyone shopping here (other than to be kind) would be to not go here on a time crunch. Each aisle and display area is packed with unique finds. Often they really only carry one or two items that are identical and stuff goes quickly. Items that are alike might even be on the other side of the store. You're going to need to look on the back of the shelf or under a pile sometimes to find \"the one.\" \n\nOnce you finally make your victor lap to the cashier, they do a great job at packaging everything up. I've had a cashier wrap my drinking glasses individually with 3 sheets of paper and then double bag them together in small amounts to avoid disaster. I also bought two large pillows that looked too big to fit into their largest bags. My cashier still made the attempt to put the pillows in a bag, however. They actually fit perfectly, and she saved me potential snow, dirt, and salt stains from the winter vortex outside. \n\nAll in all, this place is worth a go.

(With Receipt) Returning Underwear and Bras - \nPurchased at another location and told that I could try them on at the store or at home with returns not being a problem; I opted to try on at home as I had been sweaty.  Tried one bras on and did not like the fit and ended up not trying any underwear on.  As such, went to return today and was LECTURED by the cashier that \"you cannot return underwear and bras and that I need to understand that policies change every day\".  I explained that I was assured at the other location that returns were not an  issue since I did not want to try them on at the store.  She proceeded to question the fact that I, as she put it, \"supposedly was allowed to try on underwear at he store\".  I said if it is an issue I will just go back to the store where I got them.  She RELUCTANTLY proceeded to process the return but continued to very rudely comment regarding this.  One Bras had 2 hairs (most likely a pet hair that got into my bag I brought them back in).  She very disgustedly (and loudly) pointed out the 2 hairs and said \"are these dog hairs or something\"?  \n\n2. (with receipt) Returning Bathroom Mats and Shower Caddy - \nWe moved to Texas at the end of April and in haste, I purchased these items thinking they were what I wanted.  Now, mid-June, I am finally getting around to returning them.  While I have the receipt, I fully expected that I would most likely just have to get store credit.  Never an issue for me as I am a frequent shopper at TJ Maxx.  The cashier however proceeded in a very rude manner stating that \"you bought these in April.. it is now June\".  I stated I know and had no issue with store credit.  \n\nWith both of the items above, she repeatedly asked me to show her what was on what receipt.  There were only 2 receipts, and they were CLEARLY marked (\"lingerie\" on the one; \"Bath Shop\" on the other).  I do mean REPEATEDLY made me point out which receipt they were on.\n\nI have NEVER been treated this way before and I sure as heck will NEVER be treated this way again!!

I like to constantly freshen up my wardrobe, change up the pillows in my house, jazz up an outfit with fun accessories - and TJ Maxx has all of this and more. While I definitely prefer Marshalls for the clothing section; Home Goods for the home goods, pun intended; I stop in TJ's primarily for their jewelry counter. \n\nThe jewelry is always replenished, has lots of sterling silver at really good prices, on-trend fashion jewelry (think Pom-Pom or tassel earrings), watches (Fossil, DKYN) and necklaces. For under $20, I often find a pick-me-up when retail therapy is needed. \n\nShout out to Zara who provides the most exceptional customer service at the jewelry counter.  She truly is a delight! We have had many conversations over the years and when I'm trying on jewelry, she becomes my \"girlfriend\" giving objective advice that really helps me decide. She has gotten to know my style and often suggests just the piece I would select for myself. \n\nOnce in awhile I find an article of clothing, but for some reason, the selection here doesn't work for my style as much as the clothes at Marshalls. I still do a walk through because one never knows!\n\nThe purse selection is a different story! Over the years I've bought gorgeous, high quality Italian leather purses and laptop bags. I prefer this style to designer brands, although I have bought a few of those here as well! They often carry Michael Kors and Coach, the same quality as found in their outlet stores. If you need a spot of color, a handbag in yellow, orange, red or fuchsia is the way to go!\n\nTheir pet selection is vast with pet beds in every size, shape and color! Toys, leashes, coats, bones, bowls, cat towers and scratching posts, they have it all at far better prices than dedicated pet stores. \n\nThe small furniture selection has surprisingly good items and deals. Great mid-century mod knock-offs. I bought a light gray leather bench for my foyer for just $125. It stores my heavy throw blankets and duvets while serving as a place to sit and put on shoes. While providing a gorgeous vignette that greets me when I enter my home. \n\nBeware the long checkout line where you are literally surrounded by impulse purchases! Coffee mugs, wrapping paper, greeting cards, candles, candy, cookies, bath soaps, insulated lunch bags, seasonal hand towels, smartphone accessories lime the aisle to tempt you, often successfully, into random must-have purchases.  \n\nDuring any holiday, this place explodes with seasonal items!

It takes me that long to sort through the different styles, and to keep running back to the racks to trade up or down sizes since different designers range so widely in their fit.

The mere mention of the name makes the mister shudder.  So I prefer to roam its aisles solo.\n\nThe pros:\n\n-From time to time, they carry my favorite jam, which generally can't be found outside of the Northwest.  And they carry it for $3.99.\n\n-They have some cute clothes at reasonable prices.  Today, for example, I found a Free People sweater that would have run me $148 at the Free People store, but TJ Maxx had it for a cool $24.99.\n\n-They have a nice kitchen section, and they even have Le Creuset cookware.  \n\n-I never paid attention to the baby section before, but now that I'm expecting, I wandered into that section today.  I was quite impressed.  They have tons of really high-quality baby clothes, toys, activity mats, Boppies, even Amy Coe wall hangings - and they're all available at a serious discount.\n\nThe cons:\n\n-The help.  They are less than helpful.  They tend to range from ambivalent to rude.  \n\n-The setup.  They have so much stuff, and not enough space for it all.  Most of the aisles aren't even big enough for one carriage to fit through, and this creates a number of traffic problems.  Also, many of the racks are so packed with stuff that it's impossible to actually look at what's ON the racks.  It's bananas.\n\n-The books.  They have children's books, but almost all of them are messed up.  The pages are bent, the covers are worn, there are scratches and dents in the books.  If I wanted a used book, I'd go to the used book store.\n\nSo while there are certainly deals to be had at TJ Maxx, you have to be willing to put up with a bit of annoyances in order to get them.
