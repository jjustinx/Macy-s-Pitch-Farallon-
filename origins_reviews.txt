They sent me a 25% off coupon (the crafty devils), so I stopped in to buy this cream I had had my eye on, Youthtopia. Seems good so far, btw, my sensitive skin has not broken out.\nAs a makeup snob, I usually shun Origins, but I have had a turnaround, because MAC is drying my skin like crazy, and you know, makeup does not have to mean dolling yourself up like RuPaul or Marilyn Manson.\n\nIf you want some very pretty basic looks, their makeup (shadows in particular) has really improved from what it used to be (their colors used to behave like translucent powder, they are much better now!). Yesterday I was lucky enough to be helped by Sarah, who is in design school, so she knows a thing or two about color. She is a huge asset to anyone looking for makeup here, take advantage of it while she still works here! Since I had this coupon, I let her sit me down in the makeup chair, even though I knew it meant a certain increase in purchase amount. She picked colors to complement my blue eyes, explaing how the colors work together, and she also used products that I normally shy away from, blush and bronzer. As a former goth gal with pale pale skin, I have always been horrified by bronzer, but I have to say, I felt so pretty the rest of the day! I had been in a fashion rut, and was feeling gloomy about my looks, and she inspired my to try a few new things with my makeup. Later that evening when I was out with my fiance, he looked at me and said, you look very pretty tonight. I know I know, I'm a modern woman, too, but come on, it is nice to feel pretty and be complimented like that. Say what you will, feeling attractive boosts a depressed mood and I needed it. She sold me their foundation and I am really enjoying it, it looks great and has good coverage, and photographs well (unlike MAC which reflected flash like crazy and made me look like a geisha in every photo).\n\nA word to the wise: these guys are under a lot of pressure to boost sales and number of items per transaction, so they will try to sell you lots and lots of stuff, which can be overwhelming if you aren't used to this. It makes a lot of people angry. Please don't be mean to them if you are in the angry camp, they are just doing their job, and as the customer it is your job to be really assertive about what you want and can spend.", "date": "2008-05-06 14:26:56"}, {"review_id": "zZxqNTSEbafeU7lYwgeaYg", "user_id": "nAv73ORycdh8RVsVl81pBQ", "business_id": "WeZbfnGzQgvysFVknWcQxw", "stars": 3.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "I found their service to be a little snooty at times, and the products not particularly effective while carrying a price tag on the heftier side.", "date": "2018-02-12 03:21:21"}, {"review_id": "88z5Nh1B0V24dosJIQtVUg", "user_id": "j6q9e0oGvTZQgu8QITRifg", "business_id": "WeZbfnGzQgvysFVknWcQxw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "tl;dr - HIGHLY recommend!

I walked away with samples of the products they recommended (checks & balances, charcoal face mask, & modern friction).

This review is a reflection on the service of THIS store in particular, and not Origins as a company. My recommendation: definitely give the products a shot, just buy them online or in another location.\n\n---\n\nI rarely go into the store, even though I pass by it frequently, as I tend to buy online. However, when some new products come along, I try to go in to check them and out and see since you can't smell them online (obviously).\n\nI went into the Harvard Square location last night to check out the Lavender Vanilla line and also to pick up another bottle of the toner that I usually buy (the purifying tonic). (I also had a coupon.) I was immediately approached by a sales associate (petite, possibly Indian, female, wore glasses) who asked what I was looking for. I told her a toner, but that I couldn't remember the name, only that it was organic. She handed me the \"A perfect world\" bottle and I mentioned that it came in a white bottle, and that I didn't think this was what it was. I also noted there was nothing on the bottle stating it was organic, and I would think that you would market that heavily. She said, \"No, this is definitely it, we changed the bottles.\" Then asked if I needed anything else. I said no and she continued to point out several of the gift options. I told her that I was fine and she said she could take me at the register. Then I said I wanted to look around more, and she pointed out more gift boxes. Finally I told her that I didn't need any help (again) and just walked away from her.\n\nNormally, when sales people are pushy, they at least have a positive attitude. This girl was quite unpleasant in her tone and demeanor. Maybe the end of a long day? Regardless, not something I would consider acceptable in a service environment.\n\nI had brought my boyfriend with me - I'm trying to win him over on some more Origins products because he already uses a couple. We started looking at stuff together and, literally, this girl was standing behind us and looking over our shoulder and pointing out all of the gift options for every line that we looked at. He got so fed up he just walked out of the store.\n\nI know this might sound trite, but I work a LOT and never have time to just go browse in a store. I was SO excited to go into that store and had planned on spending a ton of time just enjoying the smells, looking at new products, and seeing if there were some new things that I might want to start using. Within 3-5 minutes, this girl had so aggravated me, that I just bought the stuff I had in my hands and left. It was a huge disappointment.\n\nWhen she rang me up, she mentioned - once again - the holiday gift options at the register. On top of that, she sighed and clicked her tongue when I didn't want to give my personal information (i.e., address and birthday). She told me that the computer wasn't updated and I should give her the information and I had to refuse again. I mean, this girl just does not belong in a customer-facing environment.\n\nWhen I got home, I looked online...SHE HAD GIVEN ME THE WRONG PRODUCT. Not only was it the wrong toner, IT WASN'T EVEN A TONER, it was a lotion. I mean, Origins only has like 3 toners/tonics. How hard could that have been? I threw away the receipt, foolishly assuming that a store clerk would know her own product line, so now I'm stuck with it.\n\nSo, overall, a big fat BOO to the Harvard Square Origins store.", "date": "2010-12-22 18:31:17"}, {"review_id": "-iTPmHJ_EHYvm6JGOSBVBg", "user_id": "T7yrTgiYCm430pxGA7SiFA", "business_id": "WeZbfnGzQgvysFVknWcQxw", "stars": 5.0, "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0, "text": "My experience at Origins was just surreal coming in from New York, where people can be rude and boisterous.

(you know selling the old cheap skin care=frankenstein apperance=never getting ahead in life mantra) So when the divine Alyssa J. and I went to receive our free facials at Origins, I was nervous.  \n\nIt turns out, I had no need to be! The women delivering our facials were sweet and informative- made us feel instantly relaxed. Bonus points for  handled Alyssa and Johnna getting facials together humor with grace and dignitity. Most importantly,  they were not at all pushy.   It is precisely this lovely experience that started....The Addiction.\n\nI am now fascinated by Origin Products. I love the way they smell-clean and outdoorsy, not like an ice cream sundae or a Mike and Ike or whatever scents the kids are into these days. I love the way they are named-creative titles that actually describe the product without the cute and the  kitche. Most of all I love the way they feel-one of my favorite parts of the day is applying my Checks and Balances face wash, my Modern Friction dermabraision, and my Perfect World Toner and eye cream.  \n\nI do not love the price but receiving three compliments on how great my skin looks after using their products certainly made it worth the price.\n\nOrigins products are simple, clean, and effective and, unlike a lot of the trendy bodycare stores for teens, the only image they seem to be selling is good skin.

At this point I am sure I will be an Origins customer for life.\n\nFavorites: Checks and Balances face wash (inexpensive compared to other products, and you need such a tiny dab of it that one tube will last a year or two). Modern Friction scrub (use once a week for skin that glows). A Perfect World SPF 25 (great daily moisturizer that makes skin matte instead of shiny and doesn't burn if a bit gets in your eyes; smells like licorice--yum!) Dr. Weil Mega-Mushroom Skin Relief Lotion (for gals with sensitive skin, this soothes irritation and redness like you wouldn't believe; smells so good I want to drink it).\n\nThe company seems to have a policy of being liberal with the free samples, which is great... Nothing worse than buying an expensive full-size tube or bottle, and going home to realize it doesn't work for you at all. And, if you time your purchases carefully you can almost always get a free gift to go along with what you buy.\n\nThis store is small but clean and welcoming. It always smells amazing.\n\nI'd knock off a half star if I had the option, for the sometimes-bumbling sales staff. Some of them are VERY competent, though... so not docking a full star. The bad ones badger you from the moment you walk in and suggest products not really related to what you want, just to try to get you to buy more; sometimes it seems like they don't even know the product line very well.

Of course, you may prefer a more crowded atmosphere because, while the salesfolkien are knowledgable, they can also be a bit overbearing.  Some just don't let go once they know they've piqued your interest.  \n\nMy personal favorite Origins products are the ones in the \"Perfect World\" line.  The PW skin guardian has actually helped treat my eczema and, therefore, my medicine cabinet is never without it.  The PW lotions are yummy but not so potent that you feel as if you've just mounted a slip n' slide of Bath and Body Works product.  \n\nOne value tip:  Do consider their gift packs, even for yourself.  While you may not be able to justify dropping a cool $50 on skin care, you can get some great deals on their pre-packaged gift sets and also get some clever boxes and/or washcloths out of their deal.

I would spend ridiculous amounts of money on the Makeup Forever line that they push pretty heavily when you go in looking for a recommendation and on Lauren Mercier and Channel foundation since after all, the magazine experts say they are the best.  For $50 to $60 a bottle they should be amazing, right???\n\nNo!  Not compared to Origin's $27 Brighter By Nature powder foundation.  This stuff makes my skin look great, and has cut down the amount of time it takes me to put my makeup on by at least 5 minutes since I no longer have to deal with putting on cakey liquid foundation.  Another plus is that it contains SPF 35.  Amazing!\n\nHere are some other things that I've tried there and loved.  The eye brightening color stick is a must have if you have dark circles under your eyes.  I use it in combination with their concealer and it blows the Lauren Mercier concealer out of the water (listed as the top concealer in this months Women's Health - so not true).  \n\nAs for their skincare line up, I like the Modern Friction exfoliator, their new Anti Aging cream and their under eye cream.  Their bath and body items are also great.  They have a few scents that are good for guys and girls so there is no need to buy a separate product for your man.    \n\nLast but not least, they let you try all of this stuff before you commit.   This is where Gabby comes in.  You can schedule a facial with one of their sales people and they will analyze your skin, use their skin care to clean and moisturize your face and then reapply your makeup for you.  Gabby has been dead on with everything that she has recommended.

I told her what I was interested in, she picked it off the shelf for me, offered to let me smell it, and when I said I knew what it was already, she started walking towards the register. Normal transaction. Then she offered a free hand massage. Um, YES? I accept! I work with ice cream so my arms are often fatigued -- and if they aren't, a hand massage is always a nice addition to one's day off, wouldn't you say? So she set me down on a stool and salt scrubbed my arms to the elbow and my hands, and told me about the product. She put a \"souffle\" lotion on after we washed that off, and we talked about face products. \n\nSomehow, she was pleasantly personal without being intrusive (asking about my job, my boyfriend, my current skincare regimen (which is basically nothing)), very helpful (she knew the prices of the products without looking at the shelves, knew the ingredients in them and recited them without fumbling), and she was very friendly, smiley, and honestly made me believe that she loved the products as well. In other words, she was really good at her job. She even convinced me that the massage oil was a good buy, but the souffle lotion was a better buy. And if I was had, then... well, look!
